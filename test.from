Like John Dvorak, he's a professional troll.  It's his job to draw outrage.
As an embittered victim of exactly this process, I believe I have a little insight into this process.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The goals that these kids have are many and varied, but many involve a graduate degree, and graduate school is vastly easier to get into if you attend the right undergraduate school. This is particularly true in CS, where graduate schools frequently *only* accept students from a handful of schools, with almost none coming from anywhere else (aside from international students). CS is an extreme case, but many top graduate schools, as well as law and medical schools also have this phenomenon to some degree.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So these people are rightfully stressed out about getting in. It's not something wrong with them that causes this. Instead, I fault the admissions departments at the top universities they're trying to get into. Admissions departments provide applications chock full of lists of line-item activities, the clear implication being that you are at a disadvantage if you can't overflow the lists with your many and varied 'extracurricular activities.' And the people who get in bear this out: every classmate I know who got into an Ivy had a nauseating number of useless, meaningless extracurriculars that they didn't care about.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar They select for things like 'community service' and sports and high school grades. By selecting for this, they cause the stressed-out overachievers to concentrate on meaningless activities.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My solution would be to change the criteria. First, throw out every dedicated admissions officer. None of them know anything other than how to make bullshit meaningless criteria. Split admissions departments into admissions for each area of study (engineering, science, humanities, etc), and staff each department with professors from that area of study. Professors know their area, and so they will recognize when applicants do something remarkable in that area, where dedicated admissions officers, clueless about every particular field, will be blind to achievements in any kind of technical field.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Then, change the criteria so that the most important thing is to have done something remarkable (an art project, a programming project, a history paper, an english paper, an engineering project) in the area being applied for. A report on or submission of that remarkable thing should be the central aspect of the application.
Rebuttals: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Emacs is also very widely installed. And if you're planning to do any significant amount of text editing on a computer, you can probably take the small amount of time it takes to install your text editor of choice if it isn;t there already. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 2. That's not an argument for either emacs or vi. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 3. Both editors have lots of users, so this shouldn't sway you much. After all, Notepad probably has more users than emacs and vi combined, but that doesn't mean that it's a decent text editor. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 4. IIRC Paul Graham used to use emacs, but had to switch to vi at some point for historical reasons that are no longer relevant. He's going on momentum, and so should you.

Good point.  I suppose that's the idea behind Montessori education: give children access to many different interesting things to learn and allow them to choose.  That way, if they don't enjoy one thing, there are other equally stimulating things available.  However, that approach ensures that the kids are still doing something to improve their minds no matter what they choose.  I doubt anyone looks back on their life and says 'I wish I'd played more video games.'

&gt; I'm intrigued-given that you seem to think fetuses have some sort of personhood-would you support banning drug/alcohol/tobacco use in expectant mothers? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Its probably a good idea, as drug/alcohol/tobacco use can end up really messing a baby up. I'm sure there are medical limits as to what will and won't affect an infant in the womb, and that's probably where the legal restrictions should be set. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Should they be forbidden to engage in athletic activities that would tend to induce miscarriage? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That's a good question. As far as I know, there's never been restrictions on stuff like that before. I know when my mother had my younger brother, her doctor made her stay in bed for like the last 9 weeks of her pregnancy. That really comes down to a judgement call. I'm not sure that women should be legally restricted from engaging in physical activities while pregnant (maybe certain ones), but not all women are the same and different physical actions will affect their pregnancies differently. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There's not any question about it when it comes to abortion. That abortion will kill the baby regardless.
Why, because someone compiled a list of the worst geographic and cultural misunderstandings perpetrated by Americans? Why, exactly, does not knowing much about the rest of the world make me dumb?

Well of course.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Is it a bad thing to not know what is going on in the world, probably, does that really make you dumb? No. Ignorant, yes, but that is a different matter. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I am ignorant because I really don't care enough to learn about it, which is entirely different from a lack of mental ability. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That said there is a difference between ignorance and asking stupid questions.

Yes. And one might generalize, and say *all* puzzles are arbitrary.
If women have the choice to abort, then the men have the choice to support financially?  That seems to make sense.  Making it really a two party decision.  Which means the man needs to be informed of the pregnancy, and must be able to make his choice in advance so there is time for an abortion (if he decline financial responsibility).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If he isn't informed of the pregnancy, then would we argue he doesn't have to support?

I've used both AutoCAD and Sketchup. They are quite different. SketchUp is really for sketching - it actually has a specific  tool to fuzzify lines to make them look handdrawn!

Yeah.  I've been a professional programmer for many, many years, and the *only* times that I've ever seen *anything* about lines-of-code as a metric, it has been some programmer writing an article about what a stupid measure it is, and how managers are stupid for caring about it, and stupid stupid stupid. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I've never actually been asked how many lines I produce, or anything remotely similar to that.  In fact, I don't even have a vague idea of how many lines I produce. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I've come to the conclusion that all these articles are by people who've never actually worked professionally as programmers, and are projecting their imaginations of how horrible actual work must be into their absurd and uninformed articles.
As of now, there is no distinction between link relevance and quality, which is [one of the top feature requests](http://features.reddit.com/info?id=27b9) on reddit. The trouble is that the solution proposed there -- clicking a link is an up-vote for relevance -- is too implicit: you have to worry about whether or not to click a link, and there's no way to take it back. Also see RFC 2616, [Sec. 9](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html).1.1  :) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Hiding a link does not have this disadvantage. You could hide links you're not interested in, and only down-vote 'bad' links, e.g. those that are wrong, flamebait, or spam.

No, the reason to believe that there is something more than the logic allows are clues that rationality has severe problems with handling phenomena which exist, but cannot be defined or approached. newlinechar  newlinechar These are amongst others humor, taste and any kind of art. If you can come up with a scientifically firm theory of these phenomena I am eager to hear.
I'm not sure if people 'self censored' deliberately or if there was a 'this work is mine,  I only submit stuff I'm proud of' thing happening. I've discussed this with faculty and the older ones have a really strong 'less publications of better quality' and the younger ones have a 'everything that contributes to my c.v., even in a small way, is good' mentality. Sure, I'm blatantly generalizing, but at least in the earth sciences there has been a huge decline in quality accompanied by a huge increase in the number of journals. Of course, there is a corresponding request-for-papers-for-midlevel-journals trend too, because they need to keep those journals full. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Journal publications are explicitly ranked by search committees for positions, and by grant committees. Everyone knows what the first-rank, second-rank, and not-so-good journals are in a field. Sure, some great papers show up in the not-so-good journals. The converse is even more true - a lot of 'same old, same old' conservative papers show up in the second rank journals.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with some of the earlier comments that there is a 'old boys' network phenomenon here, though I would argue that it is an 'old comfortable ideas' phenomenon - people want to be challenged a bit, not a lot, and they certainly don't want papers out that cast their _own_ historic papers into questionable light. And this WILL happen - new research will make perfectly honest 'old' research either 'irrelevant' or 'invalid in new context.' So there is a social bias against really revolutionary work.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think that science (not science journals, not editors of science journals, not...) would be well served if everyone was told 'okay, you can only submit two articles for peer review per year as first author, and two more as anything OTHER than first author.' Before you scream that these numbers are too low, remember that most of the famous scientists historically didn't submit ANYWHERE NEAR this number and remember as well that spending ten hours on a project perhaps shouldn't result in being listed as an author (even fifth...). And yes, these rules are the rules I apply to myself. And I have no shortage of research grants.... etc... so obviously it wasn't a 'fatal decision' to make. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I spend a fair amount of time doing peer reviews and doing grant selection work and I can honestly say that 75% of what I see is not a credit to those who did the work. I've gotten harsher in recent months because the flow of sewage is increasing. Sigh. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

You act as though having many old theories replaced by new theories is something unique to economics, when this is actually how the scientific method works.  I mean, with any historical prospective, ALL sciences are this way.  Planetary motion is the most obvious example.  Ptolemy had a theory for the motion of the planets, which was replaced by Copernicus, which was replaced by Kepler, which was replaced by Newton, which was replaced by Einstein.  There will ALWAYS be progress with revision in science as theories and models approach and converage on 'the truth.'  It is also important to realize the the formal study of economics is relatively young, and is still growing.  It's a bit unfair to compare it to physics, which is arguably the oldest science.

That's a little disingenous, don't you think? newlinechar  newlinechar Successful exploitation of the qmail bug allows execution of arbitrary code, but only affects 64-bit systems with about 10GB of virtual memory and *no* resource limits. newlinechar  newlinechar In contrast, postfix installs have had 'portable' anonymous message destruction, unauthorized (often anonymous) relaying (via ipv6), and *all the security vulnerabilities of procmail*. newlinechar  newlinechar While you can cook up a system that is affected by the qmail bug, it's not the norm, and it wouldn't be done by any competent admin, but the postfix ones could and have happened to everyone.

OK. In other words, Muhammad having sex with a child is a myth but Muhammad going to heaven on a winged horse is literal truth? No pal, you can't have it both ways. Either all of it is true (then why respect a pedophile prophet?) or none of it is true - in which case why believe in a myth?

The fact remains that Chavez does not understand economics. He's imposed [price controls](http://africa.reuters.com/odd/news/usnN30300735.html) and now even toilet paper is short. The government blames hoarding -- yeah, that's what happens when you impose price controls. newlinechar  newlinechar The better way to help poor people is to **give them money**. If you're afraid they'll waste their money on drugs, give them **vouchers**. Further, Chavez [heavily subsidizes oil](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/world/americas/30venezuela.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin), which is actually costing enormous amounts of money. newlinechar  newlinechar Chavez will never make any progress while he continues to work against economics. newlinechar  newlinechar The 'ruling elites' don't rule the country anymore.

Us atheists actually take all your holy books at face value.  newlinechar  newlinechar When your holy book says that god created a man and a woman 6,000 years ago we know that is not correct and therefore your religion is likely bunk. newlinechar  newlinechar When we read that your god-man rose from the dead just like pagan Osiris, Dionysus, Horus, Mithra and countless others we assume it was a myth. newlinechar  newlinechar Likewise when we read that your prophet raped a nine year old child there is no good excuse for that passage to be there. If your apologetics were true then the passage would have mentioned that the marriage was 'only officially consummated' or that the prophet refuted the story to his followers. As it stands right now all those hadiths confirm that Muhammad was a pedophile regardless of the amount of spin you throw at us.  newlinechar  newlinechar We atheists don't discriminate on the basis of religion. We treat all your holy books as equally despicable as any one who objectively reads them must do so. We just let those texts speak for themselves because we have no emotional investment in them. Anything wrong with that?

He tried to claim $70,000 in furnishings provided by a wealthy cotton grower for the private part of the residence as his own, until he learned ethics rules prevented it. When a disgruntled former employee disclosed memos revealing all this, the Huckabee camp shut her up by repeatedly suggesting she might be vulnerable to prosecution for theft because she'd shared documents generated by the state's highest official. newlinechar  newlinechar Inauguration funds were used to buy clothing for his wife.

My point wasn't necessarily that one group was any worse or better than the other, only that after a list of Muslim offenses and atrocities in the parent post, proper respect had to be paid to the atrocities done by the Christians.  It seemed like the OP had as his goal to reduce the impact of Christian aggression in the region or to defray the blame onto the Muslims. newlinechar  newlinechar Both parties have plenty of blood on their hands and, to be honest, BOTH are religious groups, so when the discussion is on the relative bloodiness of religion vs. Atheism, neither group are particularly good examples of how tolerant religion is. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;While an exuberant 'historian' or two may have recorded that, I don't think there's a consensus among most scholars that that is factual. newlinechar  newlinechar Both Muslim and Christian sources say that Jerusalem was a mass slaughter, so perhaps the nature of it was embellished, but the basic fact seems to be pretty much consensual.  To be fair, the original conquest of the city by the Sassayids was a massacre, too, and I'll bet that memories of that were used to motivate the Christians 400 years later.

Here's the fundamental issue with 'Public Domain' and GPL: newlinechar  newlinechar With public domain you are free to use the code for commercial applications with out either having to recognize the author/project or make your modifications/implementation public. newlinechar  newlinechar With the GPL, you can use for profit, but you must share.  People seem to forget the entire idea behind the GPL is to improve software by sharing the code with a much larger community of developers without the fear of legal retribution.  Public domain release does not accomplish this critical goal. newlinechar  newlinechar The GPL is a software improvement process more than it is a legal framework for licensing software.  Either you get that, or you're forever lost in the woods. newlinechar  newlinechar And yes, as soon as a project is released to the public domain, the smartest thing to do is put it in a GPL wrapper from which all further development should proceed.  Now, questions is: will current and future patch submitters recognize the wisdom of this move? newlinechar  newlinechar Releasing to public domain was just the original author's way of sending a big old 'fsck you' to the GPL community (his dislike of GPL is widely known/openly stated and the reason why he eventually had to let go).  Postfix kicked qmails ass quite some time ago, but I really don't want to digress into the gory details of why and how that happened (but, yes, to some degree, it directly relates to how each project decided to license their software)

I think the comment may have been misunderstood. newlinechar  newlinechar In my mind a 'lulzer' is someone overly fond of griefing others.  One thing they do is mock people who take anything seriously on the net.  They use this belittling of net communication to mistakenly absolve themselves of culpability for their assholery. newlinechar  newlinechar I am _far_ from the position of believing that just because something is conveyed via the net it is not important.  I know that the net is just another communication channel. newlinechar  newlinechar So, I'm saying that this situation is a great example of how net communication can have serious, real-life impact, and should be remembered as proof against lulzer dismissal.

&gt; I can understand how it appears otherwise. The context of my message is particularly damning newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not really offended by it, and I'm glad it was a mistake. newlinechar  newlinechar Btw, you may want to read about [postfix mail disasters](http://cr.yp.to/maildisasters/postfix.html) if you're interested in that sort of thing. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Maybe you can entice me by telling me a bit about the features in the set that's uniquely provided for you by qmail. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know if I can. newlinechar  newlinechar For local delivery, the `dot-qmail` formats and protocols are unique. They allow users to specify mail delivery instructions without being programmers. newlinechar  newlinechar For outgoing mail, the modularity of qmail makes it easy to have multiple queues and wire up smtpd so that it injects the message into a specific queue based on some criteria. This feature I believe is only supported natively by MMDF, but MMDF has an even lower penetration than Qmail. I have scripts that modify the rates of these queues based on other network activities. newlinechar  newlinechar I can expire messages at different rates based on different criterions, which makes it easier to deliver *relevant* error reporting to my relay users. newlinechar  newlinechar My `qmail-remote` checks the outgoing IP for common rbls so that even if I get a 4xx or 5xx error, I can estimate if it is rbl-related and try a different source address. This way, my customer's don't lose mail.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are other things, but they either fall in the category of the modularity being extremely useful for inspection, diagnostic, and extension for sites large enough to need some serious voodoo, but not so large that they're Yahoo! newlinechar  newlinechar If you're comfortable with postfix's source code, and cutting into it to handle hundreds of millions of messages per month, then qmail offers you very little *functionally*. Of course, the qmail source hasn't changed in 10 years, so you don't have to 'resync' with an upstream. Not having to edit config files for 10 years is *really* nice. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You must be happy with the new licensing. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know yet. If qmail gets more contributors because of this then I'll be happy, but the fact is that Qmail is pretty feature-complete, and has been for 10 years. I really don't know what anyone can do with it. On the other hand, maybe qmail-local will get a procmail wrapper so Postfix can use it, so maybe this'll be good for postfix.

&gt;All that said, if something is a blatant lie (ie 'I said x' when we have them saying y on video) needs to be brought to attention, front and center. newlinechar  newlinechar That's all we can reasonably expect, I think. But the story in question is a perfect example of such a lie, and still no one called them on it. newlinechar  newlinechar This mindset is the reason why Creationism is taken seriously in America. People are so used to understanding everything in terms of two equally valid viewpoints that they can't understand anything more complex than 'Perspective A' versus 'Perspective B.' They both must have good points! It would be hasty to put the blame for this on the media, but I'd say it's an extremely likely candidate.
Alright, I mean basic stuff here.  Art. I, § 8: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives. newlinechar  newlinechar That is, Congress may enact and repeal legislation, not the president.  In particular, Art. 6, cl. 2: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This Constitution, and *the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof*; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, *shall be the supreme Law of the Land*; . . . (emphasis mine) newlinechar  newlinechar It is not the president's prerogative whether or not to enforce valid law.  Is it valid law?  I can't attest to whether it was duly enacted, but the income tax (notwithstanding individual details) passes constitutional muster, by Art. I, § 8, cl. 1, and Amendment 16. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know how much the executive can avoid doing without being in breach of acts of Congress, but I strongly suspect that not collecting income tax is not a legally sustainable position.  That's why I argue that were the IRS abolished, some entity would have to be empowered to take its place. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm ready to be convinced otherwise, because I'm very curious how you'd go about this.

I agreed with the idea that history creates a social framework. Current affairs create their own frameworks: see my racial profiling example. My point was that we as a society make directed efforts to change said frameworks (if we agree they cause social turmoil and/or injustice) through social pressure and by enacting laws. Certainly black americans ancestors suffered and word usage that mirrors that of the period is offensive. This still doesn't negate the fact that describing someone who isn't black by their skin color is generally derogatory.  newlinechar When I'm called a white boy in my neighborhood it isn't meant affectionately.

Then I was forced in college to debate AGAINST walmart, I thought it'd be a joke but I ended up reading adam smith and saying 'wow, this guy was right, this really ISN'T a free market and it really isn't ok.' newlinechar  newlinechar There are certain times when monopolies are inevitable, or even 'good'. A good thing to do in this situation is to limit those monopolies, not necessarily in size but in operation. Free markets are efficient because they produce were P = MC, it's not too hard to figure out ways to get monopolies to act similarly. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, if you're interested, read some of Adam Smith's own writings on market flaws. It's really interesting! These guys (smith, jefferson, etc) predicted EXACTLY what was going to happen to our society in such amazing detail and accuracy. Corporations, central banks, misguided foreign wars, giving up rights for safety, I mean it all ties together so beautifully and its PRECISELY what they all warned us against - telling us HOW and WHY it would happen, yet we let it happen.

'The very word 'secrecy' is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.

This is my biggest fear.  Although Paul has now successfully out raised every other candidate, it is not reflecting well in the polls (He's growing yes, but not exploding like he should be).  People still don't know who he is and I assume he's not getting much airtime on MSM.  Every time MSM mentions news of 'the candidates' they show Hillary, Obama, Rudy, and Romney.  Its subliminal, but it works.  Anyone else is not really taken seriously because they aren't 'a candidate'.  Then again, I haven't seen a poll for NH since he started TV advertising and was at 8%. newlinechar  newlinechar I have a few suggestions of what I think might help, so I'll spell them out and take any feedback: newlinechar  newlinechar -Advertise in the newspapers around here (NH).  I read the Eagle Tribune and I never see him mentioned*. newlinechar  newlinechar -Spend money in the forgotten states.  States like NY and MA have lots of delegates and yet they are not paid attention to because by the time they get to vote, all candidates have dropped out and the parties have made up their minds.  These voters are DYING for attention.  If you just mention somebody's name it could be worth a vote.  In addition, by spending money in these states you force Romney and Guiliani spend money in their own states too.  I don't think this is something that they would have planned for.  If they start slipping in the Polls to Dr. Paul, it could make them look weak as leaders.  This also has the spillover effect because people in the early states have many friends and relatives in the late states.  I think a good advertisement for a politician would be on the LIRR or subway with a few of his issues.  I always find myself staring at interesting advertising for a long time because theres nothing else to look at. newlinechar  newlinechar -Tout military donations and record-breaking fund raising in advertisements.  I think many people still view Dr. Paul as a fringe candidate because they don't know anyone who's voting for him!  People like to follow the crowd, so make sure they know the crowd is voting for Paul. newlinechar  newlinechar -Dr. Paul - It couldn't hurt to show pics of him delivering a baby.  People love that. newlinechar  newlinechar -Go to supermarkets and public places and hand out copies of his writings.  I've read that stuff, and its damn good.  Take out an advertisement and run it in the paper.  I'll throw down for that.  If anyone does this make sure you put his phone number (1-877-RON-PAUL) on the material.  Old people hate technology. newlinechar  newlinechar *The one time I heard Paul mentioned in the Tribune was from a comment that the early republican debates were too crowded, and the columnist said 'he would wait for fringe candidates without a chance like Ron Paul to drop out.'
Because they're talking about 'We'll kidnap you and rape your cow' UFOs, not the quixotic -- and, frankly, slightly annoying -- 'Why, I've seen lots of flying objects I couldn't identify' kind.
If all the plain text document contains is the name of the candidate, then it would be trivial for someone else to try all the names of the candidates and find which one matches the hash. You could add extra text, but since no one can know what that text is ahead of time, you could theoretically play with that text to create a planned collision just the same as they used the structure of PDF to do here.

I can buy that people will do what benefits them individually, that makes sense.

I don't think that's an armadillo.  Yeah, it kinda looks like one, sort-of, if you really use your imagination.

The naked women appear to have European hair styles and features.  Granted, the drawings are a bit crude; however, if you compare them to 16th century Native American artwork, it's all wrong.  They look much more similar to the stylings of European artwork dating between the 14th (or earlier) and 16th century (though considerably more crude, perhaps).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 2.) Your theory raises too many questions: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar - Why would an explorer encode all of this information?   newlinechar  newlinechar - Why would this unknown explorer not have passed his encoding method on to whoever he sold or gave the book to?   newlinechar  newlinechar - If he was murdered and the book was stolen, then surely the killer would have either noticed the book was in code prior to the murder and not murder him, or instead would have forced either the explorer or his scribe to give the decryption key prior to doing it.   newlinechar  newlinechar - If the explored died of some other, natural or accidental cause, then why were the secrets of the completed book never sold for fame and/or fortune? newlinechar  newlinechar - Even if he was encoding some of the information in the book, why would he bother encoding his star charts?  Assuming he needed them for navigation, shouldn't he have had that information readily available for his crew in case of emergency?  If he didn't need them for navigation, then what would be the point of putting them in the book to begin with?  The stars look the same to everyone, and it was already known that different stars were visible in the south than in the north. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Just a few off the top of my head. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's also my personal belief that the text predates Columbus.  Honestly, I don't have a great deal of basis for this belief... might just be wishful thinking on my part.  Even if there are, in fact, new-world plants and/or animals pictured/described in the book (which I could go either way on), I'd still hold that theory.  I mean... it's not like Columbus actually *discovered* America.

Save for the (actually most important) 'interesting take', although, given human psychology, I'd say that this point doesn't really change a thing: people will hesitate to upmod comments they disagree with, the only difference this upmod-reason makes is that people usually not bothering to rate will do so. Also, even if you think or intend to mod reasonable, it's easy to rationalize in some way or another: 'why, I don't really downmod *RobertIsbell*, but I don't think his comment deserves 5 points, either; maybe four or three or so'. newlinechar  newlinechar And your upmod was chivalrous, but was it a genuine, a good upmod? I often stumble upon comments where I think to myself, Well, I disagree with that, etc., but I don't think it deserves to be downmodded at all, let alone into oblivion. What to do? Pity-upmod or not? newlinechar  newlinechar I think It's just a mistake to group these buttons together; they have nothing to do with each other, but the symbolism/analogy/grouping encourage 'misuse'. newlinechar  newlinechar *Down* is *Report*. *Up* is *Like*, or *Recommend*.

Yeah, same here. As far as I'm concerned type classes are objects. If I can't create a new string type and use it in built-in libraries that expect strings, I don't consider it OO. Incidentally, you can't do this with CLOS or other 'advanced' object systems (basically the ones with multiple dispatch).[1] newlinechar  newlinechar [1] Yes, I'm aware of closures. However, requiring somebody to use closures for this is essentially exposing an implementation detail, _and_ it's more effort.

She made sure that her competent deputy health minister got fired, because of her dissenting (i.e. correct) views on AIDS. newlinechar  newlinechar Mr. Mbeki refuses to admit that there is a link between  AIDS and HIV.  newlinechar  newlinechar It would have been interesting if the headline read: newlinechar &gt; Mbeki has the bald-faced audacity to claim that HIV does not cause AIDS.   newlinechar  newlinechar Both Mbeki and Manto have a much larger effect on the lives of people living with AIDS than an American president 10000 miles away. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar (1) It is fair to blame him for Iraq, the price of oil, fucking up the USA economy and trying to build a death star.

I don't think the Ninth Amendment really does it.  Let's take a look at the text: newlinechar  newlinechar The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. newlinechar  newlinechar So the relevant question we have to decide here is whether a right to personal privacy was a right 'retained by the people.'  Now you can argue “yes” and you can argue “no,” but where you come down on that argument really depends on how you interpret the Constitution. newlinechar  newlinechar Small Footnote: We are now getting into the area of what makes Roe so interesting, from a legal scholar’s perspective.  Unfortunately, the blithering idiots of the pro-choice and pro-life movements have robbed the public of the ability to discuss the grace and nuance of the legal arguments presented on behalf of both sides.  This is unfortunate.  Anyway, moving on . . .  newlinechar  newlinechar There is a group of Constitutional scholars out there called originalists that think the Constitution is essentially a contract or treaty between the states, which gives them certain powers.  Now this concept of a contract, or treaty, is important because the way one would normally interpret the force and effect of a contract or treaty is according to the meaning of the terms at the time the contract or treaty was written. newlinechar  newlinechar So for an originalist, interpreting a right to privacy, in both birth control pills and abortion, is fairly simple.  The Founding Fathers had no concept of the pill or (arguably) of abortion.  Therefore the language of the Constitution doesn’t contemplate those acts.  They are not “covered” under the Bill of Rights.  Since they were unknown at the time the Constitution was written, they couldn’t have fallen into the category of rights “retained by the people.”   newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, you may fall into the category of those who believe in the Constitution as a “living document.”  In this camp, you would argue that maybe the founding fathers didn’t KNOW about the pill or abortion, but if they HAD, they would probably not have wanted state governments interfering with the right, OR that the founding fathers developed a set of underlying GUIDELINES for the protection of individual rights, and we think “X” falls into those.  There are, of course, some real interpretational problems with the living document theory.  Compare it with the penumbras: Instead of sticking our hand up the Constitution’s butt to make it say what we want, we are now sticking our hand up the respective derriers of the founding fathers, saying what they WOULD HAVE SAID.  How the hell do we know? newlinechar  newlinechar I think there are good and bad aspects of both methods of interpretation.  I would, however, like to point out that we can always AMEND the Constitution if it doesn’t say what we think it should.  Perhaps we should amend it more often, instead of leaving it to the whims of the court to develop convenient penumbras.
Mozilla's blogger is just whining, and missing the big picture.

On the other hand, the Constitution set the stage for un-original-intent federal power grabs, which we desperately need to roll back (enter Ron Paul, stage right).  In addition to rolling back these power-grabs, I think we also need to introduce some more democratizing effects, like limiting the Presidents' power even further, maybe dissolving the senate in favor of a unicameral system, etc. (not completely sure on these topics though, I'm no political scientist).

Not necessarily so. I think the point Jen326 was making was, is the killing of someone that has done no harm to you. I agree, it is ignorant to advocate something such as killing.
I am currently an engineering student and am finishing up a course in 'material properties'.  In this class we talked about the WTC incidents because they are a great--though tragic--real world example of how different materials react under many bad conditions.  When heated, metals (steel included) become more elastic; they become bendable and stretchy.  As was mentioned above, the building was VERY HOT from fire.  My professor also said that NYC was using WTC7 as a storage facility for emergency fuel (gasoline).  All this burning causes the buildings strength as a whole to be GREATLY reduced, until there is a failure.  This failure occurs at the point of greatest stress--the base of the building.  Take away the base floors of the building, and the rest will fall straight down.  Any engineer with materials experience could have told you that building was in trouble if they read the inside conditions on WTC7.  That is why we knew it was coming down.
I am not a troll! :)and I appreciate your response. All I ask is that .01% uncertainty. But many Atheists understand intellectually that they can not be sure that there wasn't some intelligent force behind the creation of the Universe. Most religious people(that I've met) understand intellectually that they can't prove that god exists but that somehow their belief in the face of the lack of evidence represents some strength of character or evidence in and of itself. I do not think Atheists believe this, and in that way pass the logical test, but they adopt their belief in the absence of god as simply the most practical solution to the problem, since it doesn't make any sense to concern yourself with something that has no apparent impact on your life. newlinechar  newlinechar In other words, to choose to not consider the possibility of god may be a rational decision on a day-to-day basis, saving time, headaches, and disappointment, but that doesn't mean it's logical. I do not believe anyone should call themselves an atheist unless they are *closed* to the possibility of any sort of god. There's a word for people who would be willing to change their minds faced with evidence one way or the other, Agnostics. newlinechar  newlinechar The definition of god is also a tricky, subjective thing. If our species discovers that there is, in fact, a Unifying Theory of Everything; A single equation that governs the behavior of all things in the Universe, I would feel free to call that equation God, and would I be inaccurate in so doing?

All the free market means is that trade between individuals is not managed by a central body.  Volunteerism is certainly not shunned in a free market, in fact it would be considered a form of barter since you are exchanging your time for a potential future benefit (orderly society).  For years, this sort of thing has been screwed up by stupid economists in places like the world bank that force countries into self-destructive policies in the name of the 'free market', when in fact the very injection of aid money and goods from foreign countries hugely skews the local markets in these countries and can be considered very anti free-market. newlinechar  newlinechar

Handling multiple concurrent downloads is a terrible use case for threads.  I don't understand why it always ends up used as an example. newlinechar  newlinechar The *only* reason threads are used here is because python ships with three or so different modules for HTTP downloads, but none of them use asyncore (or similar). newlinechar  newlinechar A proper asyncore based HTTP client would make the limits for such a thing *much* higher without making the process any more complicated... I imagine the process may even be less complicated, as it is in cocoa. newlinechar  newlinechar You wouldn't have to consider locks (technically, the GIL protects, but this example code is appending to a list from multiple threads concurrently). newlinechar  newlinechar Imagine something like this: newlinechar  newlinechar     def get(url, opaque, got_bytes, got_error, finished): newlinechar        ... newlinechar  newlinechar The only remotely tricky part would be building the abstraction to limit the number of requests so they don't all happen at the same time.

I read a similar kind of DNA study about the origins of the Kurds, who it turns out are genetically very closely related to the Jews.

At the very least, he should be let go. Personally, I think the police officer should be put in jail for assault or forced to give his victim a large sum of money for such outrageous, unwarranted treatment. I understand that the guy didn't produce his license as quickly as he should have, but maybe if the officer wasn't yelling he would have been more cooperative. Everything after that, including but not limited to the tasering, is a criminal offense and the officer should be charged accordingly.
Israel argues it has occupied these territories by right of conquest in a war started by the Arabs. The Ottomans (and their Arab subjects) also occupied the territory by right of conquest, and relatively recently.

I'm an atheist, and realizing just about everyone around me has had the traditional Christmas upbringing, and everyone loves presents, I observe the season, not really the holiday. I spend usually 20 bucks or less on some nick-knack or accessory that will make the person laugh or enjoy a moment instead of thinking about how cold it is and all the work that needs to be caught up before the new year.  To me, adding a small piece of joy at a traditional time not only makes people feel good, but also lightens up the idea that all atheists hate Christmas.

Nah, Marxism is all about decentralized social systems.  But the only forms we saw communism implemented ignored that key part opting instead for centralized bureaucracy.  Why?  Because decentralization means a lot of voluntary coordination that often breaks down due to local corruption and petty politics and such.

Sadly my pc didn't react to well to that pdf file so I didn't get to read much of it. However before the file bit the dust, I did catch a look at the map, and neither Botswana nor Malawi looked terribly hungry. It seems more a case of splitting hairs. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The Botswana 'hot spot' was smack dab in the middle of the Kalahari Desert. Very few Tswana live in the Kalahari, but I am not surprised that those that do experience a bit fewer calories than elsewhere. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Personally I find the notion that Botswana could be hungry in any meaningful sense bizarre. They can simply buy what they can't grow, similar to city folk around the world who can't grow their own find. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There are all kinds of statistics one can pull for various countries, and really screwed up countries like Egypt (finally beginning some reform by the way this year) and Libya can also do well in some categories. Especially when they get aid (dictatorship Egypt gets $3 billion a year from the US for not being a meanie to Israel) or have oil and gas resources (Libya). Also Malawi has been receiving substantial food aid for some time, I am not surprised it is on the low end of hunger. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But that is not why I linked to what I linked to. My point was that you can't blame libertarian economic failure on a country (Malawi) that didn't have even a quasi-libertarian economy. That didn't stop the liberty bashers on this site from taking ignorant pot shots though.
&gt;And of course never forget that if any who is Jewish, criticises the policies or practices of Israeli government they are automatically a 'self-hating Jew'(tm) and thus can be happily written off as a loon. newlinechar  newlinechar What does that have to do with this article or my comment?

Sometimes it is as is the behavior of most governments.  Unfortunately B'Tselem provided no real evidence of that in this instance.  This is, as far as I can tell, completely uncorroborated and it doesn't even seem like they're interested in an Israeli explanation. newlinechar  newlinechar Both B'Tselem and Camera set out to perform important and much needed services.

And you're wrong too.  Your return is the interest you're not paying on that debt.  Mortgages are at what, 6-7% now?  That's your guaranteed return from paying off your mortgage.  It certainly beats T-bills, and is close to the long-term average return on the stock market. newlinechar  newlinechar If it were any debt *other* than a mortgage (including, I believe HELOCs), you can tack an additional 30-40% onto that, because pennies saved are *after tax*.  But mortgage interest is tax deductible, so taxes don't enter into calculations.

I don't understand why he thinks the first thing to do with C++ is say 'let's not use these pieces.' I think that the first thing to do with C++ is become an expert BEFORE (or in parallel with, but with heavy emphasis on getting everything right) using it for a major project, and I agree that this is less than ideal, but I don't think the answer is to throw things out. newlinechar  newlinechar OTOH, I am not sure I could come up with a large project where I wouldn't either need to switch to C because I needed every last drop of speed or be just as well off programming the damn thing in Python and writing C extensions if ever shown necessary. For example, I recently did some profiling work on KTorrent, a KDE app written in C++ with Qt, and found that after all the headache of writing the damn thing in C++, the primary speed bottleneck was SHA-1 hashing, which you can do fast in any language by calling out to OpenSSL.
That seems to be a bit more work than is necessary. It is so easy to hide malware inside code that the whole hash thing really isn't necessary. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And besides, why would you compare hashes when you could do a real file comparison? If you are not distributing the exact program that Picosoft thinks you are, Picosoft can easily catch you.
ObQwe1234: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; this is why c++ is the most powerful language on earth. a simple expression like: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;    foo(130) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; could have any of a number of different meanings. :) it could be a function call, an initialization, or it could invoke an object's `operator()` method which could do something _completely_ unexpected, depending on context. this is why we c++ programmers get teh big moneyz. :) oh, and before you whine, remember that _all_ human languages work the same way, where a single word could have multiple meanings depending on context. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; there are plenty of good technical reasons (aside from teh big moneyz) for all of the inconsistencies and ambiguities in c++ syntax. a clear syntax is one of the _least_ important properties of a programming language. i haven't encountered a language with 'clear syntax' that wasn't dumbed down to the point where an ape could read it.

I don't think the author here is an Islamist (but thank you for using that word instead of Islamofascist), though I agree with you the response is exaggerated.  However, the issue as described in the rest of the article (Iran's proxy/ally militias and terror groups in Lebanon, Gaza, and Iraq) are enough to be worth considering, especially given how thinly stretched the U.S. is right now, and how little benefit (i.e., zero) there is in going to war with Iran.
Oh, bollocks. No, the bug was with me: I forgot to upload the new images. Sorry! newlinechar  newlinechar Have a look again and, hopefully, you'll see that moving to 64-bit makes the Haskell slightly faster but the OCaml and C++ much faster. newlinechar  newlinechar I find it interesting that C++ does so well on your 32-bit machine.

All they essentially do is remove the interesting parts of Haskell and write in a way that is analogous to C.

You are partly correct. I was making a pretty bald blanket statement. Super-sized almost. But I doubt many of you would read a 10-page paper on the subject if I would have posted that here in the comments. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Most Americans don't live in a state of fear or rhetoric.  newlinechar  newlinechar Well, simple rhetoric plays a much larger part in the american political debate than it does in many other countries. newlinechar  newlinechar 'guns don't kill people, people kill people' newlinechar  newlinechar 'don't ask what you can do for your country, ask what your country can do for you' newlinechar  newlinechar 'we are fighting for our freedom' newlinechar  newlinechar It's all pretty rhetoric with no substance. Yet the are still actively part of politics, media and therefor public opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And intellectualism is not considered a bad thing.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying there is no intellectual debate. I'm just questioning how much impact that intellectual debate has on public's opinion or your governments policy. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it is far less that it is in a number of other western countries.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Our present administration is comprised of a bunch of paranoid incompetent dolts but don't make a blanket statement about all of America based on that. newlinechar  newlinechar Not all of America agrees with the policies. newlinechar  newlinechar But you are all share responsibility for creating a culture where this ends up taking place. Wether your left- or right- winged, the current policy and public opinion has little real intellectual grounding.  newlinechar  newlinechar If anything, they just talk marketing, and do something completely incomprehensible. newlinechar  newlinechar I wouldn't be able to call the current policies in the US conservative or liberal. It is neither. It seems almost random, really. Whatever fits in the slogan. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I am not even going to touch the 'car' comment. newlinechar  newlinechar It was below the belt and also a huge generalisation.  newlinechar  newlinechar What i wanted to point out though, is that in some countries, experts have a status that is not related to their income, rather it is related to their expertise. newlinechar  newlinechar In general, being the expert on a certain area, indirectly gives you more power, because people will listen and trust your judgement. newlinechar  newlinechar Public opinion is much less for sale.
That's not true at all: newlinechar  newlinechar 'Gamers understandably were wary of game makers when the Nintendo Entertainment System came out in 1985. The 10NES lockout chip solved the problem of controlling access to the console (for the most part), but there was the issue of customer confidence. So Nintendo introduced the Seal of Quality to show gamers that the games had met quality control standards in terms of basic programming and that the games would be suitable for the entire family and thus free of objectionable content. It was mainly a marketing ploy, but it worked. [..] Publishers were encouraged to create high-quality titles in other ways as well. Each publisher was only allowed five releases per year, so effort was put into making those few titles successful. newlinechar  newlinechar Aside from being more general in its description, the Official Nintendo Seal does not vouch for quality like the old Official Nintendo Seal of Quality did.'

Incredible! It's still gone entirely over your head. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Go eat a book on statistics. It might help you understand how wrong you are. newlinechar  newlinechar I've almost certainly forgotten more statistics than you'll ever know.  Give up on the (yes, it is an) ad hominem angle, you're only making a fool of yourself. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If they were saying that only 10% of internet domains have MX records and didn't examine any then they aren't representing the Internet. If they were saying that 10% of their tested addresses had MX records and they ignore the other 90% then they're not representing popularity. newlinechar  newlinechar They're representing popularity among real organizations – which, [as you mentioned earlier yourself](http://programming.reddit.com/info/61tba/comments/c02klcf), is a far more meaningful measure than a random sample of IP addresses. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; FWIW, MX records aren't even a requirement for receiving mail. newlinechar  newlinechar Strictly speaking, no they aren't, but real organizations almost always use them anyway. I defy you to find *any* organization with a sysadmin experienced enough to install and patch qmail, yet whose DNS domain lacks an MX RR. Unless such configurations are prevalent, your insinuation that qmail has been thereby underrepresented by this methodology is entirely without merit. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Everyone- even Verisign sets up MX records for their parked domains. Ergo, you are wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar Fortunately, these particular surveys explicitly *do not sample the mail servers of parked domains*, which is more than can be said of DJB's ancient sample. (I would also point out that this is contradictory to your argument just two paragraphs ago, but it seems that logic isn't your forte so I'll let it slide...) newlinechar  newlinechar You're still befuddled by the most fundamental statistical principles with relation to this discussion, and you still haven't addressed the fact that DJB's 'survey' has not been replicated – and itself is so old as to be completely meaningless. Let me rehash my point for you slowly, since it still hasn't gone through your skull: newlinechar  newlinechar * DJB's original study is outdated and unverified. There is no data to support any claim of qmail being the #2 most popular mail server today, in any possible sense. *Therefore, calling qmail 'the #2 MTA on the Internet' is factually incorrect.* newlinechar * Studies of *businesses and large organizations* have shown qmail to be ranked much lower than #2 in the list of the most popular MTAs *among real installations*, despite its well-publicized use at a handful of sites. This does not entirely refute claims of qmail ranking at #2 in popularity by whatever alternate metric DJB fanboys think might put it in the best light, but these studies would sure as heck put such claims under heavy suspicion *even if those claims had any supporting evidence to begin with*. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, do you or do you not have the data or rational arguments to refute either of these plainly stated and helpfully emphasized points? So far you've got nothing, and I'm inclined to conclude that you are in fact completely full of hot air. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I think that public education needs to be better. newlinechar  newlinechar I do agree; however, that is completely irrelevant to this topic.

&gt; Because the decision on who gets citizenship and who doesn't is based on an arbitrary binary division, in this case religion rather than race. newlinechar  newlinechar In principle, you are right. However, the fact is that Israel is not open to non-jewish immigration. It is impossible to do so without losing the jewish national character of Israel, which is by definition a jewish state. The only way you could allow 'palestinians' on occupied territories to become citizens is annexation, which isn't something anyone would want; and even if that happened, who guarantees that once the borders are removed and the communications are open again, they wouldn't go back to suicide bombings when they don't like, for example, taxes or national holidays? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It is a plain fact that Israel is the de facto power in Israel and in the Occupied Territories, but voting rights are not extended to the people living in the Occupied Terrritories - unless they are Jewish. newlinechar  newlinechar **Citizens** newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The plain fact is that if I emigrated to the West Bank, the question of whether or not I would be granted a vote would be based on my religion.

I laughed at bottled water consumers until our local drought made everyone try to account for the amount of water they drink, use, and waste each day. Drinking from a bottle helps know how much you're drinking. It's less wasteful than a water fountain.

I should carry my water bottle with me from home filled with tap water. But if I'm in a convenience store and looking for something to drink, I shouldn't feel guilty about buying bottled water over some other drink. Water doesn't have the enamel eating phosphoric acid of carbonated drinks, nor the addictive calorie-laden high fructose corn syrup of sugared sodas, nor the possibly carcinogenic artificial sweeteners of diet drinks. newlinechar  newlinechar Bottled water encourages people to first break their addiction to the mass marketed sodas. Don't laugh at people for taking this step, encourage them to learn about the economic savings of using your own bottle later.

Sure its 100 times more liberal than downtown Riyadh or Gaza but compared to Dubai its neck and neck. newlinechar  newlinechar Ok so most of my arguments were bullshit, but consider that Dubai is closer to the 'heart' of the Middle East than Tel Aviv.

C++ is a waste of time. There's too much noise; there're too many exceptions. I was taught C++ in high school and college, but really, you could teach the same material much, much faster if you get rid of things like, 'You forgot a semi-colon! No compilation for you!' Because you have spend so much time telling people about how to work around the lame parts of C++, you never spend any time thinking about what algorithms are or how they work. 
Obviously, I failed you in my attempt to ridicule the quote below or falsely assumed everyone would remember the international press it received.

Let us not confuse the scope of Clinton's Balkans actions with the simultaneous occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. I remember that the invasion of Somalia happened under Bush Sr.'s 'New World Order' as if Gulf War I wasn't enough military action to squeeze into one presidential term. I also remember that both parties were swept up in the regrettable aggression of the cold war, but the cold war was another era, and we are living in the present. In the present, we are getting ourselves swept up in a replacement for the cold war that will prove even more regrettable. Unlike most* Republican candidates, Democratic candidates are admitting our mistakes in Iraq and arguing about the fastest way to reasonably withdraw, while most* Republican candidates talk openly about the possibility of including Iran in the brawl. We are spilling our precious blood and treasure in the ungrateful sands of the middle east, and we will have only a battered economy and international disdain to show for it.

I was about to post a new thread but then I saw yours.... newlinechar  newlinechar You see, changing ones mind on a subject, IMO, is actually quite a good thing. At the very least it is not necessarily a bad thing. It can show that someone's opinions have changed over time; That their beliefs have matured. It can show that they have sceptically reflected upon their previously held beliefs and decided that they may have been wrong. It shows that the person is not just a pandering to those who talk about 'convictions'. It is arguably the foundation of critical and scientific thinking... newlinechar  newlinechar But, in this case, Mitt Romney *actually is* a douche bag.

It may date back to the Greeks.

&gt; Yes but you fail to touch on the crux of the matter. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, I was just addressing the fear part, not the origins causes of homophobia. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Why should having sex with another man be so terrifying? newlinechar  newlinechar I think the fear is mainly nurtured. Here's the main the reason, I think: gays are less likely to reproduce. It's not really a natural fear for the child, but one that is encouraged in children by the family: parents, and as often grand parents and siblings who learned it from the above. It starts very young and is not explicit and not concious for many, it's done simply by enforcing gender role which teaches what both sex are supposed to be, which eventually includes sexuality. Ultimately harmful, I think, but a kind of *protective instinct* (at least in part cultural) nonetheless. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Men who fear penetration accordingly often treat women as lesser beings - because they are penetrated. newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry, I'm not touching that one with a ten foot pole (no pun intended...) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I do think this situation has something to do with a primal fear of being dominated and subdued through a particular interpretation of penetrative sex. newlinechar  newlinechar The great phallus, as feared as it is venerated! Yes, there may be some truth in this...
Because it's nice. Because it leads to the kind of society that I'd like to live in, where harmless individual differences are accepted. Isn't that reason enough?

I know a few people in Dubai who are not even citizens, and they're doing very very well.

Tourism is Dubai's largest export, and hence its reputation is the most important thing. newlinechar  newlinechar Still, other people are jealous of Dubai's success, and they refuse to accept that a Muslim middle eastern city can be better than European or American cities.

Ext is not really comparable to these libraries. Ext is meant to build complex UIs, not as a Javascript-enhancing library. It is more comparable (but way better than) jQuery UI, YUI and Dojo widgets. newlinechar  newlinechar Have a look at the demos: they don't show you how to make an XHR request, instead they show you how to make a feed reader with tabs and a customizable UI. newlinechar  newlinechar My tought is: you have to build a desktop-like web application, get Ext (with jQuery on top of it, eventually); if you just need to enhance a 'normal' website, you don't need it.
I kind of feel the same way about my education. I get A's but I don't really feel like I'm learning anything substantially, in depth. What am I doing instead?

It's not entirely their fault.  Part of the reason is the Bayh-Dole Act, which made it possible for universities to patent research that resulted from federal funding.  This act in effect remade universities into profit-seeking companies. newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh-Dole_Act newlinechar  newlinechar Another reason is that many of them never had  proper training on how to teach classes.

&gt; The information that I have read seems to indicate that it would be stupid to try to build an app for which multiple cores would be useful, like, say, Photoshop, in Python. newlinechar  newlinechar Building something like Photoshop in *pure* CPython would be rather stupid, indeed.  But not because of the GIL; rather because CPython can be 100-1000x slower than C for raw pixel crunching.  That's way too much to compensate with hardware. newlinechar  newlinechar But as soon as you can delegate performance-critical portions of the processing to a suitable subsystem (e.g. PIL, NumPy, a GPU, or even stuff written in Pyrex/RPython and similar tools), the GIL quickly becomes mostly irrelevant.  Ruling out CPython because you cannot imagine using a layered implementation approach is more than stupid. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And then you're programming in C newlinechar  newlinechar Or perhaps Java ;-) newlinechar  newlinechar (given the current work on [Jython 2.5 and beyond](http://www.lysator.liu.se/upplysning/20071017.html), I wouldn't be too surprised if Jython/Java turned out to be an important platform for high-performance Python in a not too distant future...)

You redeemed yourself with this post.

Blizzard makes the killer apps which is what keeps people from throwing away their PCs. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, you need to upgrade for UT3 sooner than for WOW. But you still need pretty respectable hardware to run WOW:TBC on full settings and I know many people who have upgraded their PCs specifically for WOW expansions. newlinechar  newlinechar WOW gets people hooked and gets people to not throw away their PCs. WOW creates communities of PC gamers... and then as individuals move to other games, their WOW friends hear about it and move too. WOW is IMO the best word to mouth marketing environments there is. newlinechar  newlinechar Team Fortress 2 is an excellent example. I have a friend who was in a wow guild, and he came and played TF2. He told his guild, and all of these people who had raerly played any other PC game (wow was either their first PC game or the only one they still played) went and bought TF2. Not all of them stayed - but that is the nature of every new release. Most went back to WOW. Some upgraded entirely to see TF2. newlinechar  newlinechar But Valve sold a ton of copies thanks to WOW word of mouth advertising.

That's just the wonder of the internet. It makes people feel safer and more secure about speaking out because they aren't face to face with people (and they don't have to leave their chairs to do it).

Nothing much, if anything, will change by this. newlinechar  newlinechar *edit: Merger Press Release from Blizzard* ([http://www.blizzard.com/press/activision-faq.shtml](http://www.blizzard.com/press/activision-faq.shtml)) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Q: What are the details of the deal? newlinechar A: Under the terms of an agreement with Vivendi, Blizzard and the other companies that make up Vivendi Games will combine with Activision to form a new public company called Activision Blizzard. We do not anticipate any difference in Blizzard's operations as a result of the combination. Joining forces with Activision will create a stronger and more diversified company that we anticipate will benefit and strengthen both brands. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: What will happen to the Blizzard brand name? newlinechar A: The Blizzard brand name will stay the same as it's always been: Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: What will change with regard to the day-to-day operations at Blizzard? newlinechar A: There will be no changes in the way Blizzard operates. All of the people, processes, and philosophies that have made Blizzard so successful will be preserved. Blizzard will benefit from all-star sales and distribution teams to service our products. In addition, the combined company will be stronger financially, managerially, and operationally. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: How will this impact Blizzard's games? newlinechar A: This will not impact Blizzard's games. We remain committed to providing the same high-quality game content and support that we always have. Development on Wrath of the Lich King and StarCraft II, as well as on our unannounced games, is continuing as normal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will there be any visible differences in Blizzard's logo or packaging/marketing materials as a result of this deal? newlinechar A: No, there won't be any changes to our company name, logo, packaging/marketing materials, or anything else along those lines. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will there be any management changes at Blizzard as a result of this deal? newlinechar A: No, there won't be any management changes at Blizzard as a result of the combination. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will Activision and Blizzard now share development teams? newlinechar A: No, both of our companies will continue to operate as they have previously with regard to game development. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will the release schedules for any Blizzard games be impacted? newlinechar A: No, the transaction will not have any impact on our games, our day-to-day operations, or our release timelines. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will any of Blizzard's offices close as a result of the deal? Or, will any new offices open? newlinechar A: No, all of our offices will continue to function as they have, and we don't foresee the need to open any new offices for the time being. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will any employees move to different offices as a result of the deal? newlinechar A: We don't anticipate making any such moves as a result of the deal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Does this deal include Activision's and Blizzard's international offices? newlinechar A: Yes, every part of our companies in the U.S. and abroad is involved in this deal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: If Activision Blizzard is a public company, does that mean I'll now be able to buy stock in Blizzard? newlinechar A: Activision will be renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc and will continue to be a publicly listed company traded on NASDAQ. You will be able to buy stock in the combined company. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: When will the transaction be complete? newlinechar A: The transaction is subject to approval of Activision shareholders, customary closing conditions, and regulatory approvals. Pending approval, the companies expect the transaction to be completed by mid 2008.

What you wrote was really complicated and difficult to comprehend. newlinechar  newlinechar I can understand that both Blacks and Whites have a right to say something ala Freedom Of Speech but what we should *always* acknowledge is that words can be just as harmful as weapons. Sure, by Freedom Of Speech we have a right to say what we want but we should interpret it in a similar manner to this; newlinechar  newlinechar 'Your freedom to swing your fist ends at the tip of my nose' newlinechar  newlinechar You have a right to say what you want, but racial vilification and racism should not and simply cannot be tolerated. Those words that you use to vilify another person - you've seen the emotions it stirs, what it causes, if you're going to use such offensive language you may as well have punched their faces in. The acceptance of racism spawns more racism + ignorance and leads to all the problems that we had in the past. I think it's pathetic that one side has invested so much into righting their wrong-doings (yeah whites fucked up big time but they're trying hard to amend it. *real* hard.) whilst another group in this case blacks helps to propagate the problems of history and negate their efforts whilst continually criticizing whites for being the forebears of such problems. This is simply not true.

It depends on your engine. In some engines you have to have the fields listed in your SQL in order before it will use the combined index.  Also the combined index may be ignored if you only ask for one or two of the fields. newlinechar  newlinechar Very few applications always ask for the same fields in the same order all the time. newlinechar  newlinechar You have to take it on a case by case basis. newlinechar  newlinechar A good database can give you a report of the top 10 longest running queries every day so you can optimize them. newlinechar  newlinechar Overall I agree with urusai.

I used to be sorta dragged into these very conservative Christian Youth conferences and I still remember several years ago (I couldn't have been more than 12 or so) when the church service started off with a similar video on this gigantic screen when thundering speakers, except this video was 10x as graphic with worms crawling out of burning bodies and screaming and blood everywhere. newlinechar  newlinechar As an atheist, it was appalling to see not only all these literally hundreds and hundreds of preteens to young teenagers scared shitless and crying, but all the little toddlers who were screaming. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, the first two videos weren't really all that bad.

There are in fact many cases where C++ beats C in practice, unless you resort to really questionable macro techniques in your C code. For example, say you want to write a sorting function and have it inlined at a call site specialized with a particular comparison predicate. In C the predicate would usually be passed as a function pointer, which makes it very difficult to optimize (in practice, I've never seen a C compiler do it); in C++ the predicate would be anything implementing the bool operator()(const T&amp;) protocol at compile time (the predicate type becomes a template parameter), and if you pass a function object rather than function pointer, inlining  and specialization is possible (any decent compiler would do it). You could get a similar effect in C by putting your sorting function into a macro, which C die-hards have been known to do, but you really shouldn't have to engage in such evil rituals.

I haven't even touched on other types of subsidies like R&amp;D. Being the cheapest does not mean being the best....I bring up lead laden toys at wal-mart as an example. Keeping energy centralised is vital to retaining power. You can't get people to fight for oil and no bid contracts in the mid east if everyone has an electric car and solar panels.
It's more complicated than you're thinking. Your hands and arms aren't in the right place to handle the torques involved. Consider that the reciprocating motion is along the x-axis while pivot point for the arms lies high along the z-axis. newlinechar  newlinechar In the presence of gravity, the knees of the male provide a fulcrum for his motion, while the knees of the female stabilize the target. Without these two knee-points, the system will quickly degenerate as the male and female rotate in opposite directions about the y-axis. newlinechar

Ok so you are for the economic downturn of America?  We can all slippery slope.  It is called business, and treaties are business, it is the worst contract to enter because it is unfair to the most successful economies and unfairly puts almost no measures on China or India's rapid growth and higher pollution. So apparently using malcontent logic you are pro-China and pro-India.
'These comments do not contradict Chomsky's anarchist ideology.

&gt;C is simple enough that writing/porting a compiler is manageable, and it has a standard. newlinechar  newlinechar I think, there are many other languages with these properties. Heck, even Pascal, with a couple of additions from any commercial implementation, could be that language. newlinechar  newlinechar IMO, by far the most important advantage of C is that it (was) picked up as means of writing an OS, with UNIX development. It grew with that. *Everything* else followed. Kind of a suite of lucky circumstances (no disrespect meant there, C ;-) ).

As a Christian, I have to agree with you. Live and let live, as they say. Who cares if a movie is anti-religious or pro-religious?
For the most part I agree with your statement AngryProfessor, although I think you are ignoring some of the benefits of having researcher teaching classes. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar First, there aren't a whole of other people who could teach some of the specialized higher level classes.  There might only be a few hundred individuals in that nation with the knowledge and experience to teach EBME 461: Biomed Image Processing and Analysis, and I bet 90% of them are academic researchers.  A lot of generic intro classes like MATH 101: Principles of Addition and Subtraction could be taught by educators working off generic lesson plans, but the higher level courses require someone with a passion for the field. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That passion for the field and their extensive experience is another benefit of learning from researchers. Anyone can assign reading and quiz vocabulary words, but only an expert in the field can put together a curriculum that prepares someone to enter their own field.  Hell, half the readings for some of my courses was straight from journals since the work was too new to be in any textbooks, and to really test our learning one final project was an NIH grant proposal (I now sympathize with those who prepare them on a regular basis).  These courses could only be taught by practitioners in the field. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I agree that some courses could be taught by educators; people who do nothing but teach.  In my opinion that means such courses are either primary school level or bullshit.  Anyone going to a research university should intend to become a professional in their field, and the prerequisite knowledge can only be learned from other professionals actively practicing the field. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The problem isn't that professors are forced to do research at universities, the problem is that universities have been transformed from centers of learning to diploma mills.  I think the apprenticeship nature of universities with experts of the field teaching the next generation is the ideal learning environment. The problems is that universities are no longer focusing on eduction, but instead on vocation, and then doing so poorly. If all someone wants is a certificate to get a job, they should acquire it from a vocational school tuned to that field.  If all you want to do is fix broken toilets and install sinks then you don't need course work in non-newtonian hydrodynamics; you need plumbing vocation.   Likewise a computer science degree maybe overkill for designing web pages and a chemistry degree is overkill for being a mixing technician.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It looks like it gets better at the graduate level, or so I pray.  If I find any bullshit in my grad program,  I am dropping out to become professional cyclist/triathlete; fuck computer-aided drug design.

Skepticism is a great first step. newlinechar  newlinechar The next step is research. The author provided links to all of his claims. Did you follow them? Did you do your own research? Is there any specific claim you'd like to dispute? newlinechar  newlinechar In addition, if an organization is founded to do charity or other good, and meets the requirements for tax-exempt status, I think the author would agree that it should be tax-exempt. That includes churches that have a stated goal of doing good, does not discriminate in its hiring or in it's distribution of services. newlinechar  newlinechar SOME churches do a lot of good, but the important criterion should be that they do good, not that they're a church.

I try to shrug it off as a minor annoyance that whenever I do something successful, every capitalist out there wants a piece of the action.”

I'm not trying to troll or be insightful or state the obvious here, but every time the 'next big thing' comes in, every one jumps ship on the old 'big thing' and runs right to the new one?

I agree, but not knowing myself, do you know how much energy windmills (one could buy to put on top of their house) can output on average?   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I've heard that under optimal conditions 1 square meter of sunlight is equal to about 1000 watts an hour.  With current solar panels able to convert about 15% (maybe 20%) of 1000 watts you're left with 150 watts or enough to power a few light bulbs.  So you'd need probably at least 10 square meters under optimal conditions (probably more because most of us aren't located at the equator at noon) of solar paneling to cover a normal house's energy needs.  Gas and Coal still pack quite a bit more energy. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I've just looked one up, [http://www.mikeswindmillshop.com/wgenerators.html](http://www.mikeswindmillshop.com/wgenerators.html) that generates 40 watts under 10mph winds, 800 watts at 40mph winds.

Well it could lead to people being complacent and not working out something better. After all why bother working on something better when you already agreed on the Kyoto Protocol? newlinechar  newlinechar As evidence that this agreement is nothing more than grandstanding, it only took a few hours for the new Australian prime minister to evaluate its effect on Australia's future.

Today's reporters are fed what to say in their news reports.  When you watch old movies I got the impression reporters actually investigated things themselves.  Nowadays I get the impression that reporters are hired for their attractiveness/like-ability and are hired to spew out whatever they are supposed to read off the teleprompter.  More like acting now than reporting.  
I agree that the heads flying would be some token single cases, like we saw with Enron, the rest of the perpetrators will probably just lose their jobs or bonuses at worst. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm arguing for not introducing any more regulation.  What has gone wrong in the subprime market now has been because of fraud which was obscured by complexity.  This is illegal already though we may have to amend our interpretation of it which is what will come out of the court case following this crisis. newlinechar  newlinechar Repealing legislation always has an impact, and often a short term negative impact and I think this is a responsibility that should be managed.  For example if you repeal the ban on marijuana, you have to inform the public of the risks they take (and hopefully be honest about it)  It doesn't mean that in the long run we're worse off with the law repealed.

Blood transfusions didn't become practical until really the early 20th century. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So, it wasn't an issue people thought about or worried about until really the late part of the 19th/early 20th century. newlinechar  newlinechar While that's true, it's a novel interpretation of 'abstain from blood' that led to the JW doctrine in the first place.  This wasn't even debated in other Christian groups because Acts 15's commandment to 'abstain from blood' has always been interpreted to apply to a very particular case in a particular set of circumstances.

This was actually the NIE that the White House tried to prevent being released in full.  Cheney was very much trying to lie us into another war.

Thus the reasoning used by the article that sanctions had worked is unsupported.  It is probably more reasonable to say that amassing +100,000 troops on Iran's borders worked. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I also note that Iran stopped its nuclear program around the same time that it offered a 'Grand Bargain' to the US that in part promised a halt to the nuclear program: newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Irans_Grand_Bargain.html

'Except for the fact that tail recursion in Common Lisp is optional (mandatory in Scheme, of course).' newlinechar  newlinechar Tail recursion is an implementation detail in Scheme. You can easily implement a loop macro. Everyone hates a few language features (in the case of CL a lot, the nature of the beast), Lisp allows you to deal with such things on your own terms, usually you keep around a bunch of macros and functions you feel are useful. Personally I like tail recursion and never bother to implement a loop macro.

So, why're you trying so hard to turn this into a fight? Most of your reply could be answered with the portions of my reply that you chose to ignore: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; you can do the same to most sciences. inevitably, those arguments get reduced to 'we're not omniscient, and are still working on that part.' newlinechar  newlinechar Like I said previously, 'The problem there is that we aren't attempting to understand the nature of God, we're merely attempting to sort out the rules he supposedly imposed on us.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The problem there is that any time an athiest wants to beat up on a religion, he makes a strawman out of a church or doctrine that is related to (but not synonymous with) that religion. newlinechar  newlinechar I'll leave a response to that up to some atheist that's actually doing that. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; yeah, most church doctrines are pretty easy to knock down. they're 'inconsistent with reality' etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Then I guess that makes them wrong, doesn't it? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; i can do the same with any high school physics book. newlinechar  newlinechar I double-dog-dare you. newlinechar  newlinechar The various sciences are, by their nature, consistent with observed reality ... _because observed reality forms the entire basis for the scientific method_. They are, occasionally, inconsistent with each other, however, as our observational ability has increased, we've historically found good ways to resolve those inconsistencies. newlinechar  newlinechar I haven't seen any similar resolution of inconsistencies in any of the major holy books. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; that's interesting. are you claiming that 'all religions are provably false'? newlinechar  newlinechar Here you're really hoping to debate an argument I didn't make. A U.S. fifth-grader -- not the top of their class these days -- could tell you that I said no such thing. newlinechar  newlinechar If a person says, 'I believe that a God exists', and stops there and leaves it at that, then that constitutes a religion, and it is not provably false. There's no way for me to demonstrate that some supernatural being does not exist, any more than there is a way for the other person to demonstrate that such a being does exist. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem is when all of these extra rules start getting applied to it. Then you run in to problems like free will versus moral responsibility, which is a subject that philosophers have been working on to almost no avail for millenia now. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; it IS bigotry to say they're wrong as a group. newlinechar  newlinechar Really? According to dictionary.com, bigotry is defined as 'stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from one's own.' I haven't shown any intolerance here; quite the opposite. You're failing to make a distinction between judging an idea to be wrong, versus not tolerating that idea at all. newlinechar  newlinechar If you had your way, nobody would ever be able to follow any religion, because every religion requires that you accept it as correct and other religions as false, which would -- according to you -- be bigotry. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; because your assertion is founded on an assumption about an entire group of people that is not only unreasonable, but provably false. newlinechar  newlinechar Good! My assertion wasn't very long, so it shouldn't be hard for you to point out just where it was unreasonable. Or, at least, provably false. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; it would seem wise not to post judgements about groups of people based solely on their beliefs... newlinechar  newlinechar Here, at least, you might have something, but it would be based only on a misunderstanding. I can judge a particular idea to be wrong, without negatively judging the character of the person adhering to that idea.

Actually, SVN has some issues of its own. For example, the fact that you can commit to multiple branches at the same time is pretty ugly (and it will haunt you when the time comes you want to migrate to a DVCS). newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that SVN integrates the tags/branches axis into the directory hierarchy axis makes it easier to use for many who have no prior experience with SCM systems, but it has some problems (like the one stated).
The chances are not independent at all, and statistics is a treacherous and complicated subject. newlinechar  newlinechar House prices, interest rates, labour conditions, economic growth, etc, have a strong correlation among different parts of a country.

Even if the first defaults are taken by others, the chance of a landslide in defaults stays considerable.

Sixty meters underground, a river used to run through the limestone of the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Because the limestone was uneven in density and porosity, the river carved an irregular channel, widening and contracting. Eventually, over a very long period of time, the surface of the land above underwent changes resulting from diminished rainfall. As the volume of water draining through the underground river decreased, the channel it had carved became a cave. Nonetheless, a trickle of rain still flowed through cracks and crevices, enough to maintain stable pools of fresh water in the lightless depths. newlinechar  newlinechar In one such pool lived a small school of fish of the family Characidae. Characids are an adaptable group, occupying many ecological niches of the planet Earth. The characids of this geologically isolated pool had several distinctive adaptations, the most unusual being that they were eyeless. Thus we can identify them henceforth as blind cave fish. Lacking sight, the blind cave fish were well equipped to detect vibrations of any sort through the sensory cells of their lateral lines, which was how they foraged for food as well as how they located each other for mating purposes. Fortunately, water is a superb transmitter of vibrations. Greater self-awareness would not have been adaptive in the bleak conditions of their pool, but if they'd possessed it, they would have had no reason to suppose that any other characids inhabited any other pool in this or any other cave, or indeed that any other pool in any other cave was inhabitable. newlinechar  newlinechar The blind cave fish had two rigid requirements for survival--oxygen and food. The oxygen in the pool was maintained at roughly the level they required by the dependable trickle of rain which replenished the loss of water through the porous limestone bed of the pool. Also, the water was cold--a constant forty-one degrees Fahrenheit--which of course allowed maximal oxygenation. Although the fish had no 'knowledge' of it, a grave danger to their survival existed in two kinds of pollution: nitrates from their own metabolic waste products, and gradual mineralization from the influx of acid rain water seeping through the soil. Periodically, however, drenching storms would flood the land, refilling the underground river channel and flushing the pool. newlinechar  newlinechar Most of the blind cave fish would be swept away to an uncertain fate, but enough would survive to rebuild their population. Even the most catastrophic flushing would not decimate them, since their eggs, which were adhesive, were always laid in protected chinks and cracks. Had the floor of the pool been smooth, or had the flooding carried other menaces into their cave, no doubt the blind cave fish couldn't have thrived as they did. It should be noted that the thick layers of rock above, which shielded them from hot sunlight, also shielded them from ultra-violet and other forms of radiation that might have threatened their survival. newlinechar  newlinechar The blind cave fish were dependent for their nutrition on another intricate and improbable set of circumstances. Since no light whatsoever penetrated the cavern, no photosynthesizing plants or algae could flourish. Nonetheless, populations of microbes and nearly microscopic arthropods shared the pool. These were the food source upon which the blind cave fish depended, though they supplemented their diet by scavenging the corpses of their own dead. In turn the arthropods and microbes were dependent on bat droppings for 100% of their nutrients. The bats, in huge numbers, infested a large dry cavern of the same cave. The only above-water outlet from their cavern to the fresh air above passed through the grotto of the pool, the ceiling of which was too encrusted with stalactites to attract bats to nest. Thus the quantity of guano the bats dropped in flight was always enough to sustain the pool's organisms yet never enough to poison the water. newlinechar  newlinechar The blind cave fish were by far the largest and most metabolically active of these aquatic creatures. Having neither predators nor competition, they had ample reason to be happy with their lives--that is, had they had enough self-awareness to exhibit happiness--since each and every condition of their environment seemed specifically suitable to their needs, while any variation of those conditions would have made their life impossible. Indeed, the conditions in which they subsisted were so random yet so improbably assembled that it must have seemed to the fish--again granting them the self-awareness to consider probabilities--that the pool had been designed to provide for their existence. Allowing them just a bit more rationality than they truly possessed, logic would surely have suggested to the blind cave fish that where there is design, there must be a designer. newlinechar  newlinechar No matter how much intellect we attribute to our three-inch long albino eyeless characids, however, it's clear they had no means of fathoming the nature of the designer, unless it were itself an inscrutable but omnipotent blind cave fish.

&gt;In 167 BC, after Antiochus issued decrees in Judea ***forbidding Jewish religious practice***, a rural Jewish priest from Modiin, Mattathias the Hasmonean, sparked the revolt against the Seleucid empire by refusing to worship the Greek gods. Mattathias slew a Hellenistic Jew who stepped forward to offer a sacrifice to an idol in Mattathias' place. He and his five sons fled to the wilderness of Judea. After Mattathias' death about one year later, his son Judah Maccabee led an army of Jewish dissidents to victory over the Seleucid dynasty. newlinechar  newlinechar The celebration of Hannukah is basically a military triumph party, paired with symbolism surrounding the lighting of a very large candelabra.

&gt;I would suggest your knowledge of the geopolitical role the US has played in recent decades is wanting to say the least. newlinechar  newlinechar Glad to see I'm talking to someone who stands behind their attacks. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Would you care to provide examples of altruistic military interventions you believe the US has unilaterally partaken in. newlinechar  newlinechar The Korean Conflict was an altruistic intervention, as was Bosnia.  Of course, in cynicism, I'm sure you'll spout off all sorts of reasons they weren't.  It is also quite difficult to find an 'intervention' that the US has 'unilaterally' partaken in... Iraq 1 and 2 certainly weren't unilateral as much as people like to claim. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, it might be helpful, since you continue to stand behind your demeaning and asinine assertions that my 'knowledge of the geopolitical role the US has played in recent decades is wanting,' for you to prove that.  If not, apologizing would be the civil thing to do, but its obvious that your ideology makes you label me as bad and stupid instead of reading the words I write at face value.  Such pomposity is disgusting. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I would disagree with your suggestion that the world by and large sits back and does nothing. Furthermore I would venture that the US has taken an active role in preventing multilateral corrective actions. newlinechar  newlinechar Name some times where the 'world' has acted on behalf of those nations being oppressed and actually accomplished something.  I'd be particularly interested in the times when the US was not involved or protested these actions and something was accomplished. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, your idiotic assertion that the US is 'preventing' multilateral corrective actions, is quite telling.  Prove that.  Also, explain why the 'world' is not capable of a proactive stance on issues as opposed to being a slave to the United States' choice to act or not act on world issues. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;and increased terrorism and nuclear proliferation worldwide. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd like to see you prove that Iraq *caused* that.  You can certainly prove that there is a correlation between Iraq and 'increased terrorism,' but you are unable to prove it. newlinechar  newlinechar Just a point of advice: newlinechar  newlinechar I have taken a bit of indignant tone in this post because of your continued assertions of my 'wanting' knowledge on the subjects I am speaking about.

There are rational opinions on many sides of different issues that can be backed up with facts, and I am certainly one that changes my opinion when facts present themselves.  I would encourage you further to do your best not to base *how* you read what I write on your preconceived notions of me.  Believe it or not, even someone you don't like can speak truth.  You have made a large amount of baseless assertions in your response, and I am looking forward to you backing them up.

Unfortunately, there are a handful of people in Congress and the nation who have the misguided notion that Congress 'spending the (sic) taxpayers' money' as if, magically, the money I pay to the Government was still my money. It's not, no more than when I buy an iPod that that money remains mine and Apple should really think hard about how I want them to spend it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This is a seriously terrible comparison.  You don't elect the people who work for Apple, they don't - even in theory - work for your best interest, they can't threaten you with jail time if you don't buy iPods, and so you don't get a say in how they should spend their money. newlinechar  newlinechar How can you seriously advocate that government shouldn't think hard before spending tax money?

The JVM was originally designed only to run Java, which is (for the most part) a type safe language.  And pretty much no matter how you specifically define type safety, an implementation of 'eval' is its antithesis. newlinechar  newlinechar Getting dynamically-typed languages like Python running on the JVM was always ungainly and inefficient until [Java 6 included a new bytecode to specifically support it](http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/dynamic_languages.html).  Likewise, to my highly uninformed and speculative knowledge, the JVM doesn't like to mix code and data; this is why getting C++ code to cooperate with Java requires JNI, while the .NET CLR, which followed a different security model and design philosophy, can run 'unsafe' code directly. newlinechar  newlinechar So how did they do it? My guess would have been a heavy kludge of abstraction over the actual Java bytecode, like JRuby's pre-JVM 6 implementation of dynamic typing.  There would presumably be a heavy performance penalty for this, but given jesusphreak's [positive report on Clojure's performance](http://programming.reddit.com/info/621h4/comments/c02l4p6), maybe that isn't the case. newlinechar  newlinechar OK, so I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about here.  But I agree with Aeiri that, at least on the surface, implementing 'eval' efficiently in JVM bytecode seems perplexing; and I'm curious as to how it's done.

wow, that's a fact.

I ran into so many compatibility errors where modules or dependency modules wanted Perl 5.8, that I finally gave up the ghost and introduced a 5.8 distro alongside the 5.6 just for the one script. newlinechar  newlinechar If only Perl modules could provide Solaris-like backward compatibility.
They divide out the cost by the number of cells. So you have to add in the cost of total property (usually a big piece of land, people don't like to live 10 ft away from a prison), common areas, computer equipment, etc etc. Still a lot, but not too terribly much considering.

***An email I received today*** newlinechar  newlinechar Eureka!!!!!  9 Ron Paul supporters participated in the Townsend Parade with a Merry Christmas banner and 2 Ron Paul Knoxville banners. newlinechar  newlinechar Guess who was 2nd in line at the parade?  None other than Congressman John Duncan.  I ran to him like a kid in a candy store to ask him why he endorsed Thompson.   newlinechar  newlinechar I made the comment that he frequently votes like Ron Paul, and the Ron Paul supporters would like to know why he endorsed Thompson when he votes more like Ron Paul.  For once in my life I made a politician speechless.  He stumbled for a moment and finally mustered that he likes both of them and he wouldn't say anything bad about either of them.  I let him know that we weren't expecting him to say anything bad, but that we wanted the reason that he choose to endorse Thompson instead of Paul.   newlinechar  newlinechar He pulled out his lucky pennies and started handing them out.  Needless to say I did not back down.  I was persistent and got the answer we all knew, but were waiting to hear straight from the horses mouth.   newlinechar  newlinechar I followed with we certainly would appreciate your endorsement.  He said something to the effect that Thompson was from TN, and that he didn't think a Congressional endorsement meant much.  If that's the case, then why do the endorsement?   newlinechar  newlinechar Then he stated something that is Golden, that I hope is true.  He said Thompson's probably going to drop out soon anyway!   Duncan would know, so this is wonderful.  No date was given for this, but I would like to believe rather than hope that it will be before Super Tuesday.  If Thompson drops out before Super Tuesday, then Ron Paul could very well win the state of TN. newlinechar  newlinechar My persistence continued and he finally gave me the reason 'you have to be good to those that have been good to you'.  So in summation, Duncan was saying there's one complicated word why he endorsed Thompson at this POLITICS.   newlinechar  newlinechar Isn't it slimy?  I give thanks to our Father who art in Heaven, that Ron Paul is different.   newlinechar  newlinechar For the record, I still believe Duncan is much better than the crap we have in Congress, but I never miss an opportunity to hold my representatives to the fire!!!!!!!! newlinechar  newlinechar To liberty!
&gt; But to open everything up to 'the mob' is a terrible idea. newlinechar  newlinechar That's what 'democracy' means.  newlinechar  newlinechar  Right now the system of 'elite rule' is taking the richest country in the world and putting it in the poorhouse through perpetual war and unrestricted government spending.  America is well on its way to being an authoritarian 3rd world country. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Take net neutrality. We need to keep corporations from preventing us from viewing certain sites and giving preference to content. But at the same time, we can't invite the government in to help us out without making sure they won't get their foot in the door and start controlling what we want to see. newlinechar  newlinechar Net Neutrality has nothing to do with restricting access to the Web.  It just means that ISP's have to act as 'common carriers' and let everything through unrestricted, the same way that phone companies cannot restrict  who calls you or who you call. newlinechar  newlinechar If you think Democracy is bad, what do you thihk should be put in its place? newlinechar  newlinechar If you think that the problem is just that the people are ignornant, we just need to open Universities to everyone regardless of income, the way that High Schools are now. newlinechar  newlinechar That would give you an informed educated public that would be well-qualified to make decisions, at least as well as our currrent 'the internet is a bunch of tubes' Senators.

I've commented on this before, but at this hour I can't be bothered to dig through my comment history to find it.  To put it succinctly, I think police need to be elevated as a profession...pay should be roughly doubled, at least, but on the flipside, a bachelor's degree (any degree) should be a minimum requirement. newlinechar  newlinechar The vast majority of idiots that give cops a bad name could easily be weeded out by that simple requirement, but pay needs to come up to a much higher level.  It's almost the same situation as teachers - the nation suffers a shortage of teachers because a degree is required, but the pay simply does not match the investment required to get that degree in most cases.  Like the police, there are many, but not enough, who do it for altruistic reasons.  In both cases, pay and standards need to be raised so that competent individuals who are, like most people, motivated by pay at least as much as passion, will be attracted to the job while the incompetent and abusive power addicts are, mostly, washed out.

I disagree with Joel's comparison of products programmers versus in-house programmers. It is possible that he is saying this so he can hire more people for his company. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In a products company people care too much about the code. This means you will not have the freedom to use Ruby on Rails there either. If your team is filled with performance nazis forget about creating beautiful abstractions or anything interesting. You will write mind-numbing code. Also let's understand that the goal of management is to make programmers completely dispensible. You will not be allowed to write clever algorithm even if they improve performance and code readability if putting that into the code will make you indispensible. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As an in-house programmer you have much more freedom to define what the code looks like from the inside. The users only care about what it does - they don't care about how you implemented it. If you just read about this weird new style of programming where you throw exceptions instead of calling methods - you can go right ahead and implement that. No one's going to care. All they care about is that the code keeps working. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And the best jobs truly are the consulting jobs that he is dismisses completely. The salaries for consultant are not $47,000. Generally consultants make more than in-house and product programmers. Also every few months you fly to a different city and work on a completely different problem. This gives consultants a lot more raw material to think clearly about design. If you are doing the same thing over and over again you can easily refactor that into a library and reuse that. This opportunity for reuse only exists in consulting. In most product programming reuse will not give you the same multiplicative edge that it will in consulting.

But 'scientific' fact isn't the same as 'theory' in a scientific context, as has already been pointed out.
I'd call that C# major, but that's just me.
I'll begin with an apology for taking what, in retrospect, does appear to be a condescending tone. It doesn't further debate and certainly wasn't my intention from the outset.   newlinechar    newlinechar I'll address the point of contention concerning Iraq's post-war situation first. I'm afraid I would have to disagree in the strongest possible terms that it is 'difficult to say the invasion has made things worse'. Which is no mean feat considering the state of the country following ten years of sanctions, effectively crippling the country socially and economically. I'm not sure how it would be possible to conclude that life for the average Iraqi citizen was improved by the invasion. The human cost in the post-invasion years is perhaps the most damning aspect. I'm sure you're aware of the Hopkins studies, the latest of which in October 2006 suggesting a figure for deaths attributable to violence ranging between 426,369 and 793,663. In addition to the direct loss of life the effect on social infrastructure has be devastating. The limited social programs that were in place before the war became unsustainable. Right through to January 2007 electricity generation had fallen below pre-war levels. The majority of the country still lacks sanitation, 32% of the population have access to clean drinking water, 19% have access to a sewage system. There is a national shortage of food, 25% are totally dependent on emergency rations. I don't think it would be unreasonable to suggest a large percentage of the population will be forced to forgo a formal education. In Baghdad 75% of children no longer attend school, following the invasion over half Iraq's schools were declared in need of rebuilding, literacy levels are now lower among 15 year olds than 35 year olds.   newlinechar    newlinechar Moving on to the sociological effects on Iraqi society. Preceding the war, Iraq was one of, if not the only secular society in the region. The majority of Iraqis identified nationally and not along religious lines. The result of the infrastructural breakdown, outlined in the previous paragraph, and creation of a power vacuum has formented the sectarian conflict that has engulfed Iraq. Which leads into my claim that the invasion of Iraq has 'increased terrorism and nuclear proliferation worldwide'. I can't claim credit for this statement though as I'm essentially paraphrasing the CIA and practically every other intelligence agency, specialist/committee on international affairs in the world. The reasons for the increase are fairly straightforward. Partly for revenge, in the case of low-level terrorism, but on the issue of international terrorism and proliferation it is a question of self-defense. I fear this is getting a little long winded but I'll be happy to elaborate on that.   newlinechar    newlinechar For me the tangible costs of the 'just war' type intervention that took place in Iraq are insurmountable when offset against the potential benefits. To move on to my second point and return somewhat to my suggestion that the US has acted contrary to preventing human rights abuses, there are dozens of questionable examples but I'll begin with one close the previous topic. Saddam was eventually convicted for the crimes he committed in 1982, accurately so. Coincidently 1982 was the year Iraq was dropped from the list of states supporting terrorism. And support continued right through 87 and 88 when he was gassing the Kurds, perhaps 100,000, but the US didn't object. The administration at the time actually successfully blocked congressional efforts to even protest Iraq's use of chemical weapons against civilians let alone take action.   newlinechar    newlinechar This sort of selective recognition wasn't what I was really alluding to though. To get a true grasp of the inaction and active contempt for humanitarian concerns the US has shown in its foreign policy you have to look toward its record at the UN. The US leads every nation by far in its use of the veto, for starters it's easy to show that until recently the US has blocked every Middle East peace proposal thats been forwarded. There is comprehensive evidence of inaction on the United States behalf in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Declassified State Department documents show that the US applied diplomatic pressure at the UN to discourage intervention during the peak of the attrocities.   newlinechar    newlinechar Another example that is often described as an altruistic intervention is the deployment of troops to Somalia during the famine in 1992. What isn't mentioned is that the US was the chief supporter of the Somali Warlord Said Barre from 1978 through to 1990, While he destroyed the country and slaughtered around fifty thousand people. When the proxy regime collapsed in 91' the US simply pulled out and the country descended into civil war. The US still refrained from acting as the famine and fighting reached its peak in the first half of 1992. However elections rolled around in November and suddenly troops were deployed, unfortunately the famine was almost over by this time and the troops probably did more harm than good. Its actually possibly the troop deployment re-escalated the violence, US government reports suggesting 6,000 to 10,000 casualties. The point is there was a much better alternative. The bombing of Kosovo in 1999 is another example of intervening to exacerbate the problem. Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Haiti, East Timor a plethora of SE Asian countries. There really are a wealth of cases.    newlinechar    newlinechar Let me know if you require sources for anything I've claimed above.

Having recently been laid off by the company that started the Sub-Prime trend, I have to say -- that's a **bit** unfair. It's not the sub-prime industry that's exploitative; at least, not inherently. Where that comes in is in the mortgage brokers who work pure commission and have no responsibility to the customer.  newlinechar  newlinechar I've seen some heinous shit that, as the bank, we had no authority to stop. We couldn't even tell the home-buyer not to make the deal; we weren't allowed to do so. (In most cases, by the time we dealt with the buyer, the signing had already occurred and they were basically fucked no matter what.) newlinechar  newlinechar But *sub-prime* itself, were it used responsibly, would be beneficial. The problem is that everybody relied on other people to be responsible.  newlinechar  newlinechar Combine that with the massive rats' nest of regulations and procedures for the mortgaging and real estate purchasing, and it's just too much for the non-expert to make informed decisions.

The point is that every executive officer has a heavy responsibility to identify serious, violent offenders who have become such a low risk that it no longer serves the purposes of justice or public safety to spend tens of thousands of dollars annually incarcerating them.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Like governors throughout the country, Huckabee had that responsibility and he exercised it.  I don't think he exercised it unreasonably in this particular circumstance -- the man paroled appeared to the objective observer to have reformed himself dramatically, and he had already suffered an extra-judicial castration, which made it a reasonable inference that he would be very unlikely to reoffend.  Of course, we know that he did reoffend.  But I think we need to judge parole and pardon decisions on the basis of the information then available, recognizing that there is, sadly, no such thing as a sure thing.  We simply cannot afford to lock up every felon for life.  We'd prevent a lot of horrible crimes that way, but we'd also lock up a lot of people pointlessly, and at unbearable public expense. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If we crucify every governor who makes a parole or pardon decision that turns out badly in hindsight, we're going to discourage any exercise of discretion in this field.  The result won't be that the criminal justice system just keeps everybody locked up forever; rather, the result will be that the system will be administered by unaccountable, faceless board members with no aspirations to electoral office.  If that's what you want, alright, but it's short sighted and it's not going to protect anybody.  We're not choosing between a protective and a non-protective system; we're choosing between a public and a non-public system.  To keep the public system, we need to be mature about the chances we're asking these folks to take. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar An interesting and more difficult question is whether Huckabee's Christianity made him particularly gullible when presented with a professed reformed Christian convict.  I haven't seen much indication of that, though.  It looks more like the guy took a reasonable chance on somebody and got a tragic result.
Yes, but then again, the house will get broken into after the first minute. newlinechar  newlinechar That's why they're so cheap.

Isn't paying your property taxes and keeping your fences up basically making sure you are covered in that regard?  The neighbors had to cross a well maintained fence- why should you assume people are out staking a claim on your land? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, if I had some land I would use it too, but you don't know these people.  You can't assume they just didn't care about the land.  They bought it, they paid their taxes, they kept up their fences.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Why is that not enough to keep your neighbor from simply saying 'I want this land' and getting it given to them?  They didn't even have to pay for it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

'Ina Gadda Da Vita' by 'Iron Butterfly'... newlinechar  newlinechar Shouldn't this tune qualify?
That's not true. Americans do not need to go to, for example, a Latinamerican country to be hated. Actually, one of the things they are hated for is the way they are called: 'Americans'. Yeah right, we all are, no matter if we live in South or North america. Americans think they have a continent of their own.
&gt;Funding terrorism against the US isn't any kind of action, it's revenge. newlinechar  newlinechar You may be aware that 'revenge' is reactive.  You are ignoring the centuries of anti-Western and anti-freedom warfare and slaugher that radicals of many religions and secular ideologies have engaged in on their own accord.  It is indeed possible to hate people for how they act and what they believe.  You are not taking Islamic Radicals seriously because you ignore half the things they say (all of the parts about infidels, hating Jews, stoning women who go into public without a male family member, Caliphates, 12th Imams, etc) and only react to the parts where they list grievances by the United States.  They have attacked or attempted to attack many Western nations, not just the US.  The US just happens to be the most powerful and is easy to focus that anti-Western and anti-Liberal sentiment against.  Learn! newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If we are talking body count the the Christians are way ahead. newlinechar  newlinechar I challenge you to prove that :).  You may be aware that the Crusades were a delayed response to Islamic aggression. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I only say this because you appear to be anti-Islamic, if you dislike this abuse of religion then you should dislike all abuse. newlinechar  newlinechar I of course despise all abuse of all religion.  I am not sure where you get the idea that I am anti-Islamic other than some sort of assumption based on your pre-conceived notions of me.  Criticizing Islamic Radicals doesn't mean I an anti-Islam.  In fact, I hold them to a higher standard than those that ignore such problems because I know that the radicals are abusing the religion. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 
No, but focusing on the actions of individuals rather than the science and the evidence most certainly is.
Oh no, there's a Sub-Primetologist in our midst.  They do auditing too, you know.

I've written to Orrin Hatch about these concepts specifically (riders, massive complex bills, and not reading bills before passage). newlinechar  newlinechar His response was unfortunately pretty patronizing, in that he recommended I not overly concern myself with such matters, as congress pretty much knows what it is doing. newlinechar  newlinechar It pissed me off.
Well, I can easily argue you are not open to new ideas of all sorts because you are fixated on a 150 year old Theory that has been updated.  People that question it are silenced.  That's pretty closed...

No, it's definitely not original, but that doesn't mean it's not worth discussing as we head into the season.   newlinechar  newlinechar I made a realization years ago with the problem of impending holiday doom.  Back before the dot bust my wife and I were living in California.  That Christmas was the most enjoyable one since I can remember them as a kid.   newlinechar  newlinechar It wasn't until a couple years after we moved back home that I realized what was different, anticipation.  When you're a kid you're excited by the toys and the lights and the general ass kissery kids receive.  As you become an adult that excitement wears off and by the time you are an adult all you can think about is finding time and money to shop.   newlinechar  newlinechar I personally wish I could just give everyone thoughtful cards at the holidays, buy myself something kickass with the money i would have spent on presents and just enjoy the season for what it's supposed to be. 
Yep, I disagree with you therefore I must be ignorant. I must not SEE what is so OBVIOUS to someone with your worldy experience. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Or could it be that the world is a nasty brutish place, and the fact that the US has not conquered the world twice and gone on our way to conquer the Martians is a testiment to the restraint of the body politic. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar To put it another way, what do you think the Taliban would do with the firepower of the USA?
I downvoted it because it's not really politics.  And the title is misleading.  But the story is interesting.

That group of people is a majority of the country. The other side, the scientists, are an elite minority. You don't seriously think that most people can just understand computer models and high level mathematics? The knowledge economy, just like the larger economy, depends on specialization. Scientists are similar to the priests of yesteryear in that they have to create/interpret data in order for the masses to understand it. The process is still by and for themselves though. Same goes for other fields. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If someone has dedicated 5-10 years of their lives to a specialization. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they know how their field operates better than I do, and that they, and others in said field, should be the go to men/womyn if public policy necessitates it.
Ron Paul goes a lot further than 'yes they are planning something like it.' He's all the way into [wacko paranoid town](http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul349.html): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The ultimate goal is not simply a superhighway, but an integrated North American Union – complete with a currency, a cross-national bureaucracy, and virtually borderless travel within the Union. Like the European Union, a North American Union would represent another step toward the abolition of national sovereignty altogether.

Not a problem. I'd just like to clarify as well that I am not against vaccines at all. I am against the schedule in which they are given. If they would give them a little bit later in life it would solve a lot of problems. Also if people knew that they should request a single-shot dosage when they vaccinate their child in order to avoid this possibility that would help as well.
um, no. You see, have you heard of tort reform? It makes lawsuits harder to bring and so forth. That is why the cops are now apologizing.
&gt; Academic computer scientists reimplemented Engelbart's ideas numerous times in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, but none of them caught on. Either the code didn't really work, the researchers concerned themselves with publishing a journal paper rather than making a useful system, the system required a particular brand of computer, or there weren't enough people on the Internet to make it worth trying. newlinechar  newlinechar [Worse is better](http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html). newlinechar  newlinechar Specifically: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The MIT guy pointed out that the implementation was simple but the interface to the functionality was complex.

&gt;If there was a creator of the universe, it set all the rules in the first few microseconds of the birth of the universe, and has never interfered since then to violate any of those rules. newlinechar  newlinechar But in this case, the question is: did he set the rules in such a way to cause our emergence or were we just an unplanned, 'accidental' byproduct. Moderate Christians (including Catholics) tend to believe variations of the former, which unfortunately is simply intelligent design stated in another way.

There was an interesting feature on NPR recently about an 'interactive audio blog game' which focused on peak oil scenarios.

Place in a bowl and coat lightly with oil. Sprinkle with kosher salt and place potato directly on rack in middle of oven. Place a baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any drippings. newlinechar  newlinechar Bake 1 hour or until skin feels crisp but flesh beneath feels soft.

The problem is ignorant Americans who refuse to adapt to a changing world economy, who wallow in their 'faith' without taking real steps to improve their mind and their prospects, who think that just because their parents were able to support a middle-class lifestyle after slacking off in school they should be able to as well, who can tell you who Britney hooked up with, but not who signed the Constitution. newlinechar  newlinechar There is not a person in this country (without severe handicap) who is unable to work their ass off in High school, go to a high-quality state university, work their ass off there to either get a great job, or continue on to a top graduate school, and make as much income as you desire.  Sadly, there are many, many people in this country who either choose to remain lazy or ignorant.  Too bad, the world's smallest violin plays for you.  Buy your lottery ticket, it could be your lucky day, because you have already given up on EFFORT so much, that luck is all you have left. newlinechar  newlinechar Immigrants are the lifeblood of America.  Nearly every one of us comes from immigrant blood, many of us within the last hundred years.  They built the infrastructure of this country, and we are just abusing the new ones who want to contribute to it, and give themselves a better lot in the process. newlinechar  newlinechar This country will DIE if the protectionists amongst us win the ideological battle.  We must participate in the global economy, and that means that each and every one of us has to critically examine the world, and adjust themselves to take advantage of it... or be left behind...

Yeah, in the 16th century every winter was a desperate struggle to survive and if you gave your kid a present, which was probably a carving or a little knife or something, your family was doomed because then I guess you couldn't afford to buy groceries? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, anyone who has the luxury and leisure to post on Reddit can hardly accuse poor 16th century children from wanting a present at Christmas. Those greedy little shits! How dare they want a bit of joy in life. Not that it did them any good, they're dead now. So are their parents, by the way, even if they survived every winter.
'The consensus view of all 16 US spy agencies' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I read that line and my jaw dropped...  Since when do we have 16 different spy agencies?  What the hell are they?  You'd think that at least 1 out of the 16 would get it right.

Never said they weren't.  The problem I have with truthers is that anybody who disagrees is automatically an agent of the government.  For instance, you probably believe that I work for the CIA. newlinechar  newlinechar You don't address the argument with the Agent Provocateurs comment you simply say that we shouldn't trust people who disagree. newlinechar  newlinechar From Wikipedia: newlinechar 'An ad hominem argument, also known as argumentum ad hominem (Latin: 'argument to the man', 'argument against the man') consists of replying to an argument or factual claim by attacking or appealing to a characteristic or belief of the person making the argument or claim, rather than by addressing the substance of the argument or producing evidence against the claim. The process of proving or disproving the claim is thereby subverted, and the argumentum ad hominem works to change the subject.'

&gt; Runtime-driven optimizations only get you so far, and come with a hefty price: startup and 'warmup' time. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, but why is it necessary? I never quite understood why all the work of a JIT compiler is thrown away after a script has terminated. The perfomance critical parts usually run with the same types over and over again and specializations can be reused much in the same way than C++ template specializations. What am I'm missing?  newlinechar  newlinechar BTW I would rather go a step further and drop the JIT completely and work on recorded runtime types only which are used to annotate the AST of the executed program. As a result one gets specialized functions that can be compiled natively and the original script that serves as glue code and a means to fall back to bytecode interpretation in cases where type guarded dispatch can't be applied.  newlinechar  newlinechar There will be still function call overhead but it won't slow down program execution one or even two orders of magnitude. As a byproduct type annotated ASTs can be 'unparsed' into code which is explicitely typed: people get finally their refactoring browsers.

I am not a believer in ID, as I commented [here](http://science.reddit.com/info/61t6i/comments/c02kc40), but what bothers me is many of the Scientific Dogmas (essentially declared so by the media much to the chagrin of real scientists) are protected with the virulence of a religious dogma.  When the establishment thinks one way, any dissenters are silenced, just as it always has been newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Science isn't a belief system. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course it is.  It is faith in the Scientific Method as a methodology to knowledge. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Scientists do not have the same investment in their beliefs that ID'ers have. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, that is not true at all.  For example, let's take global warming researchers.  Those researching climate change that are getting funding from the government or private enterprise *have to find evidence of climate change to keep their funding!*  If they are researching it and find nothing, why are they getting paid?  The same with any disease researchers.  If I am a scientist and am researching a new xray device, for example, and it doesn't work, I won't get any more funding for that research! newlinechar  newlinechar As far as Darwinism, there are entire fields that have sprung up around the idea: Evolutionary Biology, Evolutionary Psychology, etc.  If Darwinism was proven to be false or major holes were found in it, a lot of researchers and the foundations of their research would disappear... a life's work for many. newlinechar  newlinechar No one wants to give up their life's work or the beliefs they have, religious or secular.  We like to think that personal beliefs, opinions, and interests stay out of science, but any experience in academia and research institutions will quickly show you otherwise.  There are of course exceptions, but what you say just isn't true generally. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks for the discussion.

After a bit of thinking, I came up with this: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Unless the rollers are coated so that there is no slippage, the tape bears the full load. E.g., if you are supporting 100 kg, the tape must be able to support 100 kg. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar With bearings, you can add more bearings to support higher loads. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It looks like the only friction saved is between the bearing and the guide (race) in a normal system. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So, a more complex system that saves a bit of rubbing friction (but not rolling friction).

Well I believe if elected (which would be a huge step for America) they would do the most any president/vp combo has ever done for civil liberties and individual rights in this country's histories going all the way back to when this country was founded.  They may differ on economic policies, but their pro-constitution stances, and being from both parties they could rally support for their ideas.  If they won, it would show America wants its rights back and that congress better well work to get them back as quickly as possible.  The nut jobs are the lobbyists who, even if paul/kucinich were elected, would still keep congress from passing anything that would get our country back to a constitutionally based government.

Of course I am not saying the fossil record is just made up.  No one would make that claim.  I AM saying that the fossil record doesn't exist as portrayed in modern textbooks that are taught as gospel truth and science.  Also, there are many problems with the fossil record such as petrified trees standing straight up through layers that are supposed to be different by millions of years.  These exist all over the world and are called Polystrate Trees.  Did that tree stand there for millions of years while the layers and fossils formed around it or is it evidence of a global flood?  There is also the whole problem of the fact that the fossils are dated by the rock layers they are found in and the layers are dated by the fossils that are found in them. If you study the literature with this in mind, this will jump out at you in several texts.  It is pure circular reasoning.  You might also keep in mind that if you believe what the Bible says, the earth was probably very different before the flood and what we call the Cambrian explosion where so many fossils appear all at once could just be explained by creation.  There are so many problems with the currently accepted theories that it is just a joke when you start really digging.  Would suggest you read the book 'Icons of Evolution' by Jonathan Wells.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think the Bible pretty well explains things with this verse.   newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203:3-4;&amp;version=9; newlinechar  newlinechar First of all to validate Darwin's theory, you MUST have a very old earth. Evolution doesn't work any other way.  If there is a smidgen of proof the earth is young, it all goes out the window because for Evolution you have to have time and craploads of it.  I would suggest it doesn't even work with craploads of time but that is another discussion.  If you look back you will see that these ideas of an ancient earth came from just a few scientists.  If you believe that there is no God then you can do pretty much anything you want ?right?  Furthermore, there are many highly degreed scientists that do not believe in a old earth.  If you actually look, you will find that most of what is currently taught is based on made up or misconstrued evidence.  Would suggest you watch the video.  It presents a side of the argument I don't think you have seen. newlinechar  newlinechar

My thoughts exactly. This is HUGE! If we can make CRA's pay for their gross neglegence then maybe they will clean up their act and do more to make sure that they only report 100% accurate information like they are required to by law.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm surprised that there hasn't been more cases like this. Most sources will tell you that there are millions of credit reports that contain inaccurate information. Whether it's a wrong name, wrong balance, wrong account, or flat out identity theft, etc. The law also says that credit reports have to be 200% accurate (in so many words.) So why are they allowed to get away with having so many false reports? And every time you have some false information on your credit report, it can cost you dearly.  newlinechar  newlinechar It can mean you pay higher interest rates, or you can't go on that vacation, or buy that car, or get that house, etc. The list is endless. Yet they are allowed to get away with it and you have to jump through dozens of hoops just to attempt to correct anything. And even then, you are still at their mercy.  newlinechar  newlinechar &lt;sacrasm&gt; What a great system! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

The Day God Was Born:  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Long ago, primitive people lived in caves. They had few rules and no religion. The operative social principle was 'might makes right.' The biggest and strongest men got first crack at the women and the food, and they slept closest to the fire. The small and weak got food scraps and slept in the cold dank areas of the cave. The biggest and strongest men feared only one thing, the thing that everyone in the cave feared: thunder. When thunder occurred, EVERYONE rushed to the back of the cave, even the big and the strong.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar After thousands of generations, a small man was born who was slightly smarter (due to mutation) than his cave mates. He had the ability to notice correlations between events better than other cave people. He began to notice that every time thunder happened, certain other things happened shortly before. For example, the wind began to blow harder, the temperature outside grew colder, the sky grew dark, and the birds stopped flying around.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar One day, when he noticed these signs beginning, he stood up in the front of the cave and announced, 'From now on, I get first crack at the women, the food, and the fire!' All of the big, strong men laughed at him. Then, the small man said, 'If you do not give me what I demand, my friend Thunder will come here and chase you all to the back of the cave!' Again the big men laughed. Then, the thunder came and everyone ran in terror to the back of the cave. From then on, the small man who could talk to Thunder got whatever he wanted. And that was the day God was born.

&gt; Take a recent Bush quote (paraphrased): 'Congress is acting like a kid with a credit card.' Seriously? What? Projection much? Hypocrite much?

It's not though, it's quite sensible, once you're familiar with the parts from which it is composed. newlinechar  newlinechar If `f` and `g` are any functions, then `f *** g` is the function which simply applies `f` to the left part of a pair, and `g` to the right part. That is, newlinechar  newlinechar     (f *** g) (x,y) = (f x, g y) newlinechar  newlinechar (which of course is already mentioned in the article) newlinechar  newlinechar So, here, the function `f` is `(*)` and the function `g` is `zipWith (+)`. newlinechar  newlinechar In the usual curried fashion in Haskell, the operator `(*)` is a function which takes a number as a parameter, and produces the function which multiplies by that number. newlinechar  newlinechar Similarly, `zipWith (+)` is a function which takes a list as a parameter, and produces the function which takes another list and adds the two lists elementwise. newlinechar  newlinechar So `((*) *** zipWith (+))` is the function which takes a pair consisting of a number m and a list xs, and produces a pair consisting of a function which multiplies its parameter by m, and a function which adds xs elementwise to its parameter. That is, newlinechar  newlinechar     ((*) *** zipWith (+)) (m,xs) newlinechar     = ((*) m, zipWith (+) xs) newlinechar  newlinechar Then, the function `(*) *** zipWith (+)` is composed with the function `uncurry (***)`.  newlinechar  newlinechar The `uncurry` function just takes a curried function of two parameters, and turns it into a function of a single parameter which is a pair. That is, newlinechar  newlinechar     uncurry (***) (f,g) newlinechar      = f *** g newlinechar  newlinechar So this just means to take those two functions in the pair that we got, and put them together with `(***)`, so that one acts on the first part of a pair, and the other acts on the second part. newlinechar  newlinechar     uncurry (***) . ((*) *** zipWith (+)) $ (m,xs) newlinechar     = uncurry (***) ((*) m, zipWith (+) xs) newlinechar     = (*) m *** zipWith (+) xs newlinechar  newlinechar So, this is again a function, which takes a pair consisting of a number and a list of numbers, let's apply it and see what we get: newlinechar  newlinechar     (*) m *** zipWith (+) xs $ (n,ys) newlinechar     = (n * m, zipWith (+) xs ys) newlinechar  newlinechar Which is not at all surprising, since the article started out with what was essentially that, except as a lambda: newlinechar  newlinechar     \(m,xs) (n,ys) -&gt; (n * m, zipWith (+) xs ys) newlinechar  newlinechar The difference is that the version using `(***)` and friends works entirely at the level of functions, whereas the lambda is specified in terms of what it does to particular values. It can be strange at first to manipulate functions in this way, but it's entirely possible to get used to it. newlinechar  newlinechar I personally think the lambda is slightly more readable in this case, but in many cases, the points-free style wins hands down. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, and the `liftM2` is another matter. In this case, it takes a function of two parameters, and a pair of lists, and picks pairs of elements from those lists in all possible ways, passing those to the function to build a list of results. If you're familiar with the list comprehension syntax: newlinechar  newlinechar     liftM2 f xs ys = [f x y | x &lt;- xs, y &lt;- ys] newlinechar  newlinechar However, liftM2 is actually more general, and works with not just lists, but in any monad. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Apologies for not adding an additional blank line before one of the code blocks (which caused it to not format correctly).
Sitting by itself it does, but context is everything, and I think people will be confused about an empty regex (or C++-style comment) here: newlinechar  newlinechar     my $foo = $bar // 42; newlinechar  newlinechar Compared to a real empty regex: newlinechar  newlinechar     $bar =~ //; newlinechar  newlinechar This might be a *little* confusing: newlinechar  newlinechar     my @foo = split //, $foo; newlinechar  newlinechar The , is a giveaway; and this is the only real use of an empty regex. newlinechar  newlinechar Regardless, it's a useful language feature that will improve the quality of my life... so I'm happy :)

This is hardly different from George Bushes remarks about 'removing Saddam', 'destroying the B'ath party' or 'shock and awe'. newlinechar  newlinechar For all you know he ment the name Israel should be wiped off the map or the Israeli government should be removed from power, not that the actual phyiscal land that is Israel should be nuked. newlinechar  newlinechar If he was saying that the Israeli government should be removed from power then this is absolutely no different than George Bush saying Iraqs government should be removed. America has set the precident that this kind of thing is acceptable.
&gt; Well, it looks like your reliance on Java has done exactly what the article predicted it would. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Go learn OCaml. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Learn about the power of type inference. newlinechar  newlinechar I had to crack up when I read that. 'Lo, I bring thee, mere mortal, unenlightened java programmer, the power of Hindley-Milner type inference!' And  the enlightened one saw that he no longer had to write out his types, and he saw that it was good. Oh, bollocks, wait: he also saw that his code, possessing no more type annotations, became impossible to understand after a few months save through a tedious mental process not entirely unlike what the compiler was doing automatically for him in the first place (at a time when he knew which type he wanted *anyway*)! Only, it now took the programmer, much, much longer -- powerful indeed! In the meantime, silly, unenlightened java programmer used Eclipse's Ctrl-space and -- bam! -- the type name appeared in a fraction of a second -- and was forever preserved in the source code for the benefit of future unenlightened coders. Moral: languages don't exist in a vacuum. Tools and libraries are important also. And: 99% of the benefits of type inference are obtained through type deduction. Why complicate unnecessarily? newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with you on pattern matching -- that is certainly a lovely feature (hardly unique to O'Caml, but that's a different story). But for every nice feature in O'Caml, there's also a really annoying feature. Two records with the same field name in O'Caml cause a compilation error! How embarrassing is that? (solution: uniquely prefix your field names with the name of your record. I'm not kidding.) Also, can you please tell me which compiler options I need to switch on in order to have this lovely factorial function of yours available from a DLL? What, you can't compile DLLs? Don't even get me started on the standard library... which is *pitiful* (and poorly designed) compared to java's -- and that's not taking into account the millions of other libraries which let me do whatever your can do with O'Caml multiplied by ten.  newlinechar  newlinechar So fuck off with your facile intellectual snobbery: just because you learned a language with first-class functions doesn't make you a genius.
&gt;This was unfortunately, a waste of an interview pretty much.

&gt; By the way, the 30 year old white male in 2004 had a life expectancy four years longer than his 1974 counterpart. newlinechar  newlinechar So that 12% of income was traded for 4 years of life? newlinechar  newlinechar There's no connection between the two: It's quite possible for both income *and* life expectancy to go up - it's happened in lots of places in the world.  
Hear, hear! newlinechar  newlinechar Its time the Left stood up for themselves, and Kucinich is doing that.

Unions? WPA? Trade restrictions? I can see Faux News going apeshit on those issues, and I can see the rest of MSM painting him as some kind of throwback to the depression era Leftists. I wish I wasn't so pessimistic about this, but the last few years haven't really inspired me with confidence that he'll be given anything close to a 'fair and balanced' hearing on these issues.

More people turn out for Christmas, though most understand that Easter is more important. newlinechar  newlinechar Christmas?  Pretty much universally the big deal is midnight mass/service, preceded by dinner, followed by drinking and perhaps presents. newlinechar  newlinechar Easter?

Happy story of the birth of the living God. newlinechar  newlinechar Easter?  Sad story about how the crimes of humanity are atoned for by God made man in an ultimate act of self-sacrifice in the face of an ungrateful, spiteful people, marked by the observations of our worst characteristics.  Also marked by notions that the entire Passion story (which has its own festivals outside of the proper Easter service) is anti-Semitic (though, most presentations that have been offered throughout my life have blamed humanity, rather than Jewish people).

The houses really are $250. The scam is that there are insane back taxes owed on the house and it's completely uninhabitable.

True, actually.
Because then of course 9 inches would become the standard deviation, an 'average', and the 9 inch sized males would be spending thousands to be endowed over 12'+ to be considered big.
Lots of truthers just want to know...you know, the truth. I don't actively proclaim 9/11 to have been an inside job, but I refuse to simply  believe what this lying administration feeds us. I want an unbiased, third-party (that isn't paid by BushCo) report on the events of 9/11. We all do. Until that happens [never], you'll never hear the end of the incessant speculation; that's all there is to keep the investigation alive.
He is saying that people who bring attention to the fact that 9/11 was an inside job can be categorized as terrorists under all the nice new laws we have.
I would love to see it happen, don't get me wrong, the biggest issue though is getting it on tv. If it's not televised then candidates won't bother.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think perhaps instead of trying to sneak it into the primaries, aim for the general election. I bet pbs or npr would be down to host and pressure the candidates into appearing, or perhaps even a major network such as cnn could use it to boost ratings (imagine a debate ad stating with flashing graphics 'Not in 40 years has a debate like this happened etc. etc.' ) newlinechar  newlinechar Keep working on getting all the details on the site (no coming soon stuff, it's gotta look legit). We also need to make it clear that there are large numbers of people hitting this site, and petitioning television studios to host the debate. I hate to say it, but get the site dugg (and make sure you have the server power to handle it, give reddit the link so we can digg it) Endorsements from key democrats are needed, maybe Howard Dean. newlinechar  newlinechar If you can get a reporter to give a brief outline of the debate to a candidate face-to-face whether he/she would agree to appear in a debate such as this, youtube could be used to spread the idea of this debate. Find a group like 'Why Tuesday?' that has access to candidates and get them on board. newlinechar  newlinechar edit: you gotta change the first paragraph on the website, being 'sick and tired' of the debates by the media is not going to get the media or people on board. Make it so the average joe doesn't think this is just a liberal nutjob blog, but a serious effort to enact debate reform

Yes, because wiring 2 of the tallest buildings on earth with explosives and NOT A SINGLE PERSON seeing this prior to 9/11 is a much more plausible scenario than 2 planes flying into them.    newlinechar  newlinechar I'm willing to believe that parts of the US Gov lied/ignored/manipulated facts and evidence with regard to the events of 9/11, but the 'towers were demolished with controlled explosives' scenario is a ridiculous pile of shit.

&gt;130K on a 30 Year loan at about 6.5% Interest will cost them about $1100/month. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Rent, in some cases, is easily that much. newlinechar  newlinechar In an area where you can buy a home for $150K, I find it hard to believe that rent would be $1100/mo.

No, creationism is the rejection of data. 'Truthers' (although I'm sure someone as smart as yourself must know that we all have different opinions and thought processes) have formed our opinion because of data.

Your answer to NetPhantom is correct.  An angry email won't do much.  If that was your point, then fine, I agree.  newlinechar  newlinechar But then he took the trouble to post here, and this isn't email.  It's a public forum.  The real and but implicit point is that dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of people will read it.  That is the point.  I don't need the group to validate a simple, self-obvious demonstration of what should be obvious to anyone else as well and whether or not they upvote that post is relevant insofar as it is an indicator of agreement with the sentiment, which is that obnoxious companies should be shunned.   newlinechar  newlinechar So, like I said, put that in your marketing study.

Depending on the person, I would have no reason to think something that serious would be nothing but a joke. Even when sober. It is ridiculous to think that if they do happen to carry out what I had thought they were joking about, and it resulted in a death, that I should be punished for it for nothing more than letting who I thought was a friend go pick up some food or something to that effect when jokingly saying he is going to rob a house on the way out the door.  newlinechar  newlinechar Once again, the rest of the world 'gets it' but the US doesn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is one of those older laws that violates civil liberties more now than ever before. If I were to allow my friend to borrow my gun for hunting and he's caught shooting someone with it later, I shouldn't be held accountable for HIS actions! What if is was my wife? Not only would I be destroyed emotionally, but my entire life would be destroyed by default with this law and I'd rot in jail or get the death penalty for nothing more than trusting someone, who I thought was a friend, to go hunting with. That is just lewd. 
Go back to whichever OS you came from. You'll be happier.
&gt;The problem is that we give the islamic retards airtime. It would be the same as allowing the head of the KKK to speak for Christianity. newlinechar  newlinechar Except there are an estimated 10% of Muslims who are 'retards' as you say... that's 100,000,000 FYI.  If 100,000,000 want to establish a Caliphate and slaughter infidels, you might want to take them seriously.  You don't, you ignore them and pretend they'll go away. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Only ones that have directly attacked them. The July 7th London bombings were the UKs first ever Islamic attacks, meanwhile the Glasgow airport attack was Scotland's first ever terrorist attack in our entire history going back to the stone age. newlinechar  newlinechar You may be aware of incidents like the [1997 Luxor Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_1997_Luxor_massacre).  I wasn't aware that 50 Swiss tourists in 1997 were responsible for attacking Islam? newlinechar  newlinechar What about all of the incidents in the 1700s and 1800s? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;only an imbecile would believe 'they hate freedom' as a rationale. newlinechar  newlinechar Hey, well, it seems quite irrational to blanket dismiss something you disagree with, but you are quite talented at it.  Again, do you listen to what they say?  They (radical Muslims) hate the West and others because we meddle, but *also* because of what our values are.  Values are important, and the Western Liberal value system is the antithesis of a closed theocracy that these radicals want.  Ignoring 100,000,000 people that are actively attacking infidels is ignorant and dangerous.  You still are not taking them seriously. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;These 'leaders' have killed millions over the decades. If you grew up knowing that your father was killed in a US-led coup, would you not be angry? newlinechar  newlinechar They have every right to be angry, but that doesn't explain everything.  It is part of the puzzle, its not so black and white as to say its the 'meddling West's' fault. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Have you ever even read about the crusades? The sacking of Constantinople? I've never read anything as brutal as that from Islamic history newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sorry to hear that.  I've read a lot about the Crusades, and I am surprised you would cite them without knowing of the massacres on both sides.  In fact, I am surprised you are unaware of many massacres and wars *started* by the Islamic Caliphs and Muhammad himself, such as: newlinechar  newlinechar [The Banu Qurayza Massacre of 627](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Qurayza) newlinechar  newlinechar [The Granada Massacre of 1066](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_Granada_massacre) newlinechar  newlinechar You may also want to check out [Muslim History](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_history).  Wikipedia also provides a good overview of the wars and expansion by Islam (it wasn't for centuries that Christianity did anything like that after it had been corrupted by leaders of nations, Islam has always been violently expansionist). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Really? Or Islamic expansion through conversion. Big difference, though I admit I may be wrong in this respect, it's far from my specialist subject. newlinechar  newlinechar It was almost all conquest.  Most individuals were told to convert, become Dhimmi, or die, and that has been fairly constant throughout history. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Your use of 'infidels' as a derogatory term kind-of gives it away. newlinechar  newlinechar Gives what away?  Infidels are merely individuals who don't believe in the Prophet, etc.  It wasn't derogatory, it was accurate, and it wasn't meant in a derogatory manner. newlinechar  newlinechar I appreciate the discussion, and you bring up many good points, but I think some simple research on Islam might help your point of view and its accuracy. newlinechar  newlinechar Christianity has done some horrible, horrible things.  But Islam and what it means, many of the historical events and actions brought about under Islam, as well as many of its central tenets, make it very clear that 'hating us for our freedom' is not as foreign or absurd as you may think. newlinechar  newlinechar Its more nuanced than you make it out to be.  I acknowledge it isn't *all* because they hate our freedom, but its certainly not *only* because we meddle... that would be purely reactionary on their part and the evidence just doesn't support that assertion. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks.

But he has commented on 9/11 conspiracies, and [dismissed them as non scientific](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4948621206141114750&amp;q=chomsky+9%2F11&amp;total=135&amp;start=0&amp;num=10&amp;so=0&amp;type=search&amp;plindex=5). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;they also need a justification for their crimes newlinechar  newlinechar And it is readily available, they don't even have to fabricate evidence, they'll just search for the report that contains what they want, even if it is over a decade old. newlinechar  newlinechar That's it, that is as far as they will go. newlinechar If they could have planted WMD in Iraq to justify the invasion - wouldn't they have done that? You might argue that at that point they had already gotten what they wanted (Iraq), but wouldn't *Lex Luther* have tried to maintain credibility (for Iran)? For the mastermind of 9/11, that would have been nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar They still oppose Marxism, and it can still justify action (just as it did in the 60s and 70s).

A stronger dollar would be better for me, as well, because I like things like BMWs and trips to Europe. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, if the dollar was *stronger * than the Euro, even I would begin to get worried.  newlinechar  newlinechar What is your reason for wanting a stronger dollar?
&gt; That is, Congress may enact and repeal legislation, not the president. newlinechar  newlinechar What I said has absolutely nothing to do with enacting or repealing legislation.  As for enforcement, I suspect Congress would have a very difficult row to hoe on that one.  I am not a lawyer, and I haven't read the full federal legal code, but my understanding is that having a drop-off point in each state's capital with strict instructions for the general citizenry to voluntarily surrender assets to those offices, enforcement falling to local police, would be sufficient to suit the letter of the law. newlinechar  newlinechar Ironically, that would probably in fact be more efficient than the current system (in my humble estimation), though the gross proceeds would of course drop off precipitously and send Congress into a panic.

Yes, Clinton is beholden to corporate interest, but nowhere near as much as George Bush. Jesus Christ, anyone who will ratify Kyoto cannot be as beholden as he is. I didn't say she was good, I said she wasn't as bad as he is. newlinechar  newlinechar Similarly, she has said she will keep troops in Iraq til 2013, but Bush plans to keep them indefinitely. Anyway, Obama has said the same thing. I'm not completely convinced this is a bad thing -- how else are we going to keep Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Iran out? Do you have a suggestion? We have discussed Iraq countless times in my government classes and nearly every scenario ends with some form of longterm American presence there. newlinechar  newlinechar As for Iran, I would be surprised if Clinton doesn't change her position somewhat given what's come to light. That's another *significant difference* between her and Bush -- she doesn't blindly hold to wrong ideas in the name of sticking to her guns.  newlinechar  newlinechar As for Gore and Bush, plenty of people said it, most notably Nader: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Nader, who said he planned to be in the audience on Tuesday night, called the Democratic and Republican parties a 'corporate party with two heads' that does not want any competition. newlinechar  newlinechar You may remember that Nader is a significant part of why Gore lost the election.

That would be Obama.  One of my most favorite values about Obama is his lack of dogmatism, willingness to think about issues, and willingness to consider that people who disagree with him might have some valid points and might be worthy of respect. newlinechar  newlinechar No, I do not see those values in Kucinich.
He just expressed his personal opinion.  You mocked him for it... and then did exactly the same thing.

&gt;How often are incumbents here in America defeated in Congressional elections? newlinechar  newlinechar That's a red herring - the tide of congress changes all the time.  Enough to matter anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Term limits prevent the same thing from happening in the executive branch newlinechar  newlinechar No, term limits create short term custodians instead of leaders with vision.  That's why Bush doesn't give a fuck about the US.  He has no need to care, history will already remember him as dumber than Dan Quayle.  
My country also desires to go to war and bomb the fuck out of you, maybe it is hard enough to withstand temptation without fuel being tossed on the flames.

Kudos for making me actually think. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The LAW is the LAW that existed before time began. And it has little to nothing to do with shellfish or stoning homosexuals.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Actually the laws that are negated are spelled out. Acts 15:29 states the only requirements 'abstain from things offered to idols, from  blood, from things strangled and from sexual immorality.' Other than this, the whole of the law is dispensed with for the gentile. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar and it had been dispensed with the Jew (and Happy Hannukah or however you spell it for any Jewish brothers and sisters that make on to this anti-semetic website) by Roman law for decades when Acts was written. Yeah, the bible says that gays can be stoned to death. But Rome said you can't kill anyone without our permission.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As to whether God would strive to clarify the changes, I think he did.

I think this sentiment ignores the alleged harassment that was being dished out by Megan; if she truly had another side as a bully, then the picture is not so clear. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: After reading the other posts on that site, I'm sensing possible sociopathy (or a troll at work), and doubting that the whole episode was a case of regrettable behavior. I still stand by my original statement: a person could make poor choices in the face of ongoing harassment.

&gt;Personally, I think that it is rather difficult to have an intelligent discussion when people in threads resort to attacks on the conversation itself rather than contributing anything of value.  Maybe next time you'll concentrate on the content of my message rather than nitpicking the exact grammar of post. newlinechar  newlinechar Why would I bother trying to counter the content of your post when the truth of the matter is that I agree with you, but you never bothered to find out what I thought; instead you used sloppy reasoning to arrive at assumptions.  You may call that 'whiny pedantic bitchery,' but I call it a perfectly reasonable objection to a blatant misrepresentation on your part.   newlinechar  newlinechar That said, the fact that you turn hostile when caught in an act of sloppy reasoning, instead of admitting your error, does not speak well for your character.   The truth is that I am absolutely correct that this kind of thing goes on all the time on Reddit, and as such, I think it's absolutely reasonable to point it out.  You made a choice to take offense.
well, no, I didn't literally mean that we should stick America's phallus into Israel's gaping sandy vagina, but I think it's still a decent analogy.

Yet they feel comfortable driving a one-ton vehicle at high speeds down a highway, while on the phone, within a few feet of other vehicles that are also traveling at high speeds.   newlinechar  newlinechar I don't get it.  Checking fluids is quick and easy. Making sure your tires are properly inflated is also easy. Changing headlight bulbs is very quick (and does not require a battery disconnect).  newlinechar  newlinechar Every vehicle comes with a manual that lists basic maintenance needs, and at what mileage they are to be done. You don't even have to personally do them.  Take your car to a garage once in a while to get it examined.  Don't wait until the car dies on the side of the road. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I look at computers the same way.  If you don't regularly maintain it, clean it, perform back-ups, etc. its performance will decline, or worse, you could lose all your data.

The transcript felt fake, from both sides. Who says 'my good sir' in that situation? Who has ASCII art ready and uses it after their cat just died? Even ignoring that, though, the customer's story lined up too perfectly to not be fake.

If you are building a web site and expect to take more then two million hits per day then you may want to think about using something other then ruby and rails. newlinechar  newlinechar If you like ruby and would not mind using another framework like merb or whatnot then you can probably push that up to 2.5 or 3 million hits per day. newlinechar  newlinechar I guess it depends on what your expections are for your project.  For most people though it's fine. Most web sites don't really get that busy. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Until you throw in memcache. newlinechar  newlinechar you have to have memcache of course.

With over 60,000 tickets handled in our RT system over the past five years, I'd say it's extremely well suited to high volume incident support where incidents are raised by end-users, have to be tracked over time, have to be billed by time spent, and have to be prioritized or workflowed within anything from a two man shop to a multilevel organization with hundreds or more reps interacting with users.  It also works well as a project or customer request tracking tool.  It is *not* ideally suited to bug-tracking by default, but would be easily customized for that.  Note that we don't offer end users a web login, they use email.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think 'issue tracking' is a general case, and 'bug tracking' is very domain specific.

No, trademark law won't help, it was my copyrighted writing and photography that was infringed. I suppose it could be argued that my site's 'look and feel' was its trademark, they copied the whole site including the look and feel, but this is a rather vague issue to pursue when the copyright infringement was so clear. Copyright is the appropriate venue. I could hire a lawyer and go through Federal courts at extreme expense to stop the infringement, or I can use the DMCA to stop the infringement immediately, which costs me nothing but the time it takes to fill out a form letter. I could recoup any financial damages in a court action, but I don't care about that, I just wanted them to stop.

A steam-based version control system looks a lot like a sophisticated branch and merge system. The key difference is that streams have definite hierarchies. Normally each stream only interacts with its parent and child streams.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Lets say you and I are working on unrelated features. We would each have a stream dedicated to our feature. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar When I am happy with my changes, they get pushed to a shared development stream. Once there, you can pull them into your stream. It would be rare for me to send you a patch directly. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The development stream would generally have a QA stream as a parent, which in turn would have a release stream. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar All movement between streams are done in changesets, never individual files. These are usually strongly linked to an bug tracking system. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Since changes are constantly flowing along well established paths, merging is much, much easier.

The ongoing discussion in Germany is, if that 'church' is breaking existing laws or not. Untill now (and I guess it wont change) there wasn't enough evidence against Scientology (just having 'anti-constitutional' tendencies is nothing illegal in Germany, promoting 'anti-constitutional' ideas/ using 'anti-constitutional' tactics can be against the law under certain circumstances). newlinechar  newlinechar And the word 'ban' might be a little bit misleading. In this case, it would mean, that Scientology could loose its right to act as registered (US based) society. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I do not see them as a big problem yet. I have seen them in our city, offering 'free tests' and I nearly felt sorry for them, since everybody just ignored them. :P

Many Americans are pro-life. Deal. Furthermore, the President doesn't have the power to overturn Roe v. Wade. Think about it. If he did, Dubya, Reagan, Bush Sr. or Ford would've overturn it long ago. newlinechar  newlinechar Ron Paul is not a creationist, nor does he want to dictate state school curricula. He has explicitly said he believes in evolution. He is, after all, a doctor. newlinechar  newlinechar The state governments can set up their own health care systems if their citizens freely choose to. We don't need a national government to do that for us. Many states already have some form of universal health care, including California and Massachusetts. newlinechar  newlinechar He is not in favor of any regulation of gay rights at the federal level; Washington DC is unique because it is not a state.

I'm in a slightly different boat, as I'm a rock climber, but I'd imagine it's much the same for both. I got to know people from the local scene when I was starting out and learned everything I could from them. I also read everything I could get my hands on; there are a number of classic mountaineering books describing every aspect of a climb. newlinechar  newlinechar From there it was just practice - my friend and I started out with a rope, harnesses, a length of webbing and a few biners toproping at our local cliffs. Over time we picked up gear based upon our needs; a set of nuts here, some cams there, etc, and started dabbling in lead climbing. newlinechar  newlinechar Over time my experience grew, and I started attempting longer, harder, more dangerous routes. Right now I'm working on my aid climbing skills in preparation for a push up El Capitan this coming summer or next (we may hit up the face of half dome first, but one of the two at the very least). newlinechar  newlinechar So I guess the answer is, it comes gradually. Gear looks expensive at face value, but when you spread it out over many years it's not that much money. When it comes to taking on a rock like El Capitan, or a mountain like Everest, it's just one step at a time. I kept on looking for harder, longer climbs with more exposure and crazier surroundings, and one day I realized I was at the level to be attempting some of these defining faces.

&gt;Largely due to the user interface. It has to be learned, but it's simple, hard to forget and rarely changes. The same cannot be said for computers. newlinechar  newlinechar I honestly don't think a person who has used nothing but Win95 since it came out would have much trouble using a WinXP box.

In practice, the typical office user performs the same small handful of computer tasks 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for the duration of their career.

Suppose we assume what you say is true. newlinechar  newlinechar (which has not been proven, NOR even alleged by the prosecution.) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Then, in this worst-case-picture, he plans to drive buddies to rob someone. Thus, he is guilty of robbery, by being a direct accomplice. He knew what they were going to do, they had planned so and so criminal activity, and boom. Now, there is something to be said about appearences. If his friends were living psychopaths but somehow he wasn't aware of this, then he truly is innocent as an angel. If he knew they had violent tendencies, then he shares some responsibility for their actions, for he is an enabler. If he knew they were homocidal maniacs, then he is guilty as sin. Not one of these facts is proven. If we wanted to try him for mens rea (state of mind), then we HAVE to set a trial for that component of argument. We can't give him a trial for a bullshit legal construct that EVERY court in almost EVERY country and almost EVERY STATE COURT IN THE UNITED STATES has deemed as complete bogus, and then fault him for different reasons.

It's the first bullet point, not the second. Sort of. As I understand it (IANAL) I have to pursue infringers when they come to my attention, or it can be argued that I've let the copyrights lapse. Perhaps I'm getting this mixed up with trademark law (like Hormel sued people to stop them from using Spam in technology products.. trademark dilution). I'll have to doublecheck the laws. But as others have argued, my trademarks ('trade dress' as embodied in my website look and feel) were also infringed.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know about the second point, I don't think there's a time restriction, as long as the infringement is ongoing (in this example, a website continues to post infringing work). Sure you could use the DMCA as a 'perpetual copyright' if you file false claims beyond the expiration of the original copyright, but that is illegal, now there's a term for it, 'copyfraud.' The DMCA doesn't extend copyrights, it merely provides a fast track for enforcing them.

By 'obfuscating the question' I meant the issue of household salary vs college educated male salary, brought up by someone else, not you. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Per capita hours worked have only increased by 6 minutes/day, so it's likely that most of these men are working less than their 1970 counterparts (any idea where to get good data on this?). newlinechar  newlinechar Right, averaged across the population. But as the Businessweek article claims, the hours of college educated males have worsened a lot, yet their salaries have remained flat. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So now, women/nonwhites get a bigger piece of the labor pie, and white men get less. What's the big deal? newlinechar  newlinechar The big deal is probably that while males probably provide a reference worker, sort of a lab rat of a typical full time employed worker relatively free of social upheaval. So the income of the educated reference worker has fallen a bit, whereas (if you believe the Businessweek article) his hours have increased. newlinechar  newlinechar By bringing the rise of household income into the equation, one (not you personally) obfuscates this fact by introducing the fact of social upheaval and increasing female participation in the workforce.  newlinechar  newlinechar Or another way to look at is whether the real median income per hour has fallen. We are no longer looking at white males vs minorities, or females. Just raw income per hour worked. newlinechar  newlinechar This source: http://local.google.com/answers/threadview?id=718907 newlinechar contains a few not quite satisfactory refs. The conclusion is basically that median wages stagnated, but men have fallen and women have risen. newlinechar  newlinechar Another good figure would be to compare the median wage with per-capita GDP, which would say whether the typical worker is getting the same share of the pie. I'm pretty sure that real per-capita GDP has risen, which would mean that the median worker is getting a shrinking part of the pie.

I'm not defending the above statements made by anyone else.  But conflict resolution through violence isn't automatically terrorism.  There is principled struggle, like when your land is invaded and an occupying force kills your father, and you try to resist the occupation and the further killing of other peoples fathers.  That's not terrorism, that's resistance. newlinechar  newlinechar In principle, the resistance of the erosion of civil liberties isn't terrorism by definition either.  Blowing up cars and people to arouse suspicion of everyone and promote confusion in the population, that's terrorism. newlinechar  newlinechar Terrorism is a tactic used by the violent.  It's not a position or a principle of struggle.  Please be careful about how you throw that new phrase around.  New legal definitions are being written to make it a very sharp legal tool.

The U.S. government officials and some journalists deny the charges on several grounds. They maintain that the U.S. supported only the indigenous Afghan mujahideen; that with a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamilar with the local language, customs or lay of the land; that with several hundred million a year in funding from Muslim non-American sources, Arab Afghans themselves would have no need for American funds; that American's could not train mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jouvenal.[10]; that the Afghan Arabs were militant Islamists with who were reflexively hostile to Westerners whether the Westerners were helping the mujahideen or not. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri says much the same thing in his book Knights Under the Prophet's Banner.[11] Bin Laden himself has said 'the collapse of the Soviet Union ... goes to God and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ... the US had no mentionable role,' but 'collapse made the US more haughty and arrogant.' [12] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar According to CNN journalist Peter Bergen, known for conducting the first television interview with Osama bin Laden in 1997, newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The story about bin Laden and the CIA -- that the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden -- is simply a folk myth. There's no evidence of this. In fact, there are very few things that bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and the U.S. government agree on. They all agree that they didn't have a relationship in the 1980s. And they wouldn't have needed to. Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently. The real story here is the CIA did not understand who Osama was until 1996, when they set up a unit to really start tracking him.[13] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Bergen quotes Pakistani Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, who ran ISI's Afghan operation between 1983 and 1987: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It was always galling to the Americans, and I can understand their point of view, that although they paid the piper they could not call the tune. The CIA supported the mujahideen by spending the taxpayers' money, billions of dollars of it over the years, on buying arms, ammunition, and equipment. It was their secret arms procurement branch that was kept busy. It was, however, a cardinal rule of Pakistan's policy that no Americans ever become involved with the distribution of funds or arms once they arrived in the country. No Americans ever trained or had direct contact with the mujahideen, and no American official ever went inside Afghanistan.[14] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Other sources also dispute the notion that the CIA had any contact with non-Afghan mujahideen[15] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Vincent Cannistraro, who led the Reagan administration's Afghan Working Group from 1985 to 1987, puts it, 'The CIA was very reluctant to be involved at all. They thought it would end up with them being blamed, like in Guatemala.' So the Agency tried to avoid direct involvement in the war, ... the skittish CIA, Cannistraro estimates, had less than ten operatives acting as America's eyes and ears in the region. Milton Bearden, the Agency's chief field operative in the war effort, has insisted that '[T]he CIA had nothing to do with' bin Laden. Cannistraro says that when he coordinated Afghan policy from Washington, he never once heard bin Laden's name. [16] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Other reasons for the lack of any CIA-Afghan Arab connection let alone the regarding of it as of 'pivotal importance' was that the Afghan Arabs were in reality a 'curious sideshow to the real fighting.'[17] Estimates are that there were about a 250,000 Afghans fighting 125,000 Soviet troops, while only 2000 Arab Afghans fought 'at any one time', [18] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Marc Sageman, a Foreign Service Officer who was based in Islamabad from 1987-1989, and worked closely with Afghanistan's Mujahideen, says newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Contemporaneous accounts of the war do not even mention [the Afghan Arabs]. Many were not serious about the war. ... Very few were involved in actual fighting. For most of the war, they were scattered among the Afghan groups associated with the four Afghan fundamentalist parties.[19] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar According to Milton Bearden the CIA did not recruit Arabs because there were hundreds of thousands of Afghans all too willing to fight. The Arab Afghan were not only superfluous but 'disruptive' angering local Afghan with there more-Muslim-than-thou attitude.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jouvenal.[20] Veteran Afghan cameraman Peter Jouvenal quotes an Afghan mujahideen as saying 'whenever we had a problem with one of them [foreign mujahideen], we just shot them. They thought they were kings.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Many who traveled in Afghanistan - Olivier Roy,[21] Peter Jouvenal.[22] - reported of the Arab Afghans' visceral hostility to Westerners there to aid Afghans or report on their plight. BBC reporter John Simpson tells the story of running into Osama bin Laden in 1989, and with neither knowning who the other were, bin Laden attempting to bribe Simpson's Afghan driver $500 - a large sum in a poor country - to kill the infidel Simpson. When the driver declined, Bin Laden retired to his 'camp bed' and wept 'in frustration.' [23] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

The government's 911 Commission Report outlines a massive conspiracy. It's just the official conspiracy theory. Here's the definition of a conspiracy:  newlinechar  newlinechar 1.  An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act. newlinechar 2. A group of conspirators. newlinechar 3. Law. An agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime or accomplish a legal purpose through illegal action. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That means that when the government says 19 people got together and attacked various targets around the country simultaneously, they are outlining a conspiracy. It also happens to be a bad conspiracy theory, because it doesn't fit with all the available data. How in our great nation did two planes hit the trade center one our apart from each other (we'll ignore the Pentagon for simplicity)? Someone in the Air Force chain of command had to tell fighter planes to stand down when the second plane went off course. That means either someone should have been court martialed for gross negligence or there are conspirators at large to this very day who helped circumvent standard Air Force protocol.

Everyone who replied to me is describing one demographic of Christians.

Right on. This was his big problem with the song.

What's sad is how the Bush administration is either incredibly ignorant about torture - or doesn't care. newlinechar  newlinechar You don't need to hurt someone to torture them.  I've been reading recently about the techniques perfected during the 1960's and 1970's with mental patients (some who came in for depression, only to be experimented on by released CIA docs). newlinechar  newlinechar They put people in dark rooms, covered their hands so they couldn't touch anything, and blared music at them at all or odd hours.  Prevented them from sleeping.  Shifted their feeding, and kept people disoriented for weeks at a time.  Maybe throw in some simulated drowning, or massive insulin shots to induce temporary comas, or some electroshock therapy as often as 6 times a day.   newlinechar  newlinechar The finding?  You could really fuck somebody up this way - and not lay a hand on them!  Keep it up long enough (and keep them from sleeping, for as long as possible), and you'd get them to admit to *anything* without laying a fist on them. newlinechar  newlinechar Though, afterwards, the patients would be mentally scarred for life, have difficulty holding down jobs, in some cases become infants again, suffer life-long memory issues, etc, etc, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Sound at *all* sound familiar to what's happening today with 'enhanced interrogation techniques'?  Perhaps it should - and for Bush and company to say 'Hey, it's just roughing them up a little - there's no threat to organ failure here, so it's not torture' shows that they are willfully ignorant as to what torture is - or they're evil enough to care, but do it any way. newlinechar  newlinechar Side note: I know the article is about the legal status of the people being held as 'enemy combatants' and 'terrorists', but the torture thing is as disturbing to me as is the violation of their civil rights.

&gt; Project Manhattan had thousands of people working on it all over the country, and it never leaked. newlinechar  newlinechar Clearly it has leaked, because you and I both know about it. Your claim is that it wasn't leaked until *after* the plan came to fruition.  Its been 6 years and all we have is one person coming forward (Sibel Edmonds) and thats not even direct testimony to actions, but sounds more like suspicions she has. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Estimates are that only 20 powerful people or so would have had to know the whole plot; newlinechar  newlinechar I find it hard to believe that 20 people were able to orchestrate such a convincing plot. I can accept that many others only knew part of it, but one of them could come forward and say something was out of the ordinary for them. newlinechar  newlinechar I admit that the rich (likely neocons) people behind any such plot would greatly benefit from it, but I still question the ability to keep a lid on the events so well. Even considering to hatch such a plan would have been a risk not worth taking, because during the planning phase, it would have taken only involving one wrong person and everything would have come apart and destroyed their network.  newlinechar  newlinechar Its a risk that isn't worth taking when they have other safer means to cheat the people. I'd like to see how anyone can address this point, because its not like they couldn't grab power before 9/11, because they did. Its not like they couldn't cheat people out of money before 9/11, because they did. So the risk of such a plan to such a small cabal of planners isn't worth it and therefore there is no motive that can't be explained away as too risky.

Well, the Founding Fathers had what you hinted at in mind. The problem is, it is too far gone. Slowly but surely we lost what was 'America.' It started almost immediately and it is has progressed through the years. Just look at our foreign wars. Our Founding Fathers wanted none of it...but it worked its way in very quickly and it is a part of our country's history. Give me a ten year period where we didn't have troops deployed somewhere that they didn't need to be. You may be able to do this prior to the 1800's, but is gets worse as it goes on. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not our fault. Yes, we've been complacent, but it was gone before you and I were born (even if you are 90 years old). newlinechar  newlinechar It will take a miracle. newlinechar  newlinechar My worst fear in all of this is someone like Paul wins and someone assassinates him almost immediately. Probably some whacked out 'conservative'. I just don't see any reclamation of what this country was supposed to be.

Occasionally someone will update the draft.   newlinechar  newlinechar This is why it takes so long, no one, even the implementers of the browsers, put enough effort into the development of the standards to expedite the process.

No one is arguing that illegal immigrants are hard working people, they are.  That's not the point.  Our current GROWTH is unsustainable, we need to slow down our population growth.  And maybe if we didn't have illegal labor and made people pay decent wages for labor we wouldn't have so many idle teens.
I also wonder if it's always been this way and I've never noticed because I didn't pay much attention to politics. I think both are true.

We can't feel sorry for LA because the populous is too think-headed to do anything good for itself. Portland does a fine job of planning their city for explosive growth. Massive public transit projects that actually pay off with clean facilities and safe streets. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want a better-planned city, then you have to move to one. LA isn't going to fix itself over night. I personally hate LA and the way they planned it. Just look at the highways and inefficient land use. You could be walking (driving, if you're like everyone else in LA) and see a couple blocks of nice buildings, then you'll probably come to an empty industrial-quality (shitty) lot with some broken glass and spare tires sitting on the side. newlinechar  newlinechar These infrastructure problems are much more the city officials' fault, not a couple million Mexicans that pay for the services just the same. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe you guys should send some city planners up to Portland for some tips. Seems like more and more cities with intense growth these days are modeling themselves after the successful plans of  Portland. newlinechar  newlinechar BTW, if it seems like I have a hard-on for Portland, it's just because I live there when I'm not in school. During school I'm in Corvallis, OR, which is even better for sustainable resource planning; #1 city in the USA for biking last year by some big biking mag. newlinechar  newlinechar The citizenry of LA brought their gridlock on themselves.

Just to be clear, if your EC2 instance crashes, it is *gone*.  No disk to even attempt to recover, nothing.  That can happen to 'real' machines too, but it's very unlikely across 2 or 3 - within the realm of acceptable risk for a smallish company with good backups. newlinechar  newlinechar Like I said, EC2 seems ok as a way to increase capacity by adding to existing infrastructure, but not something you would want to use exclusively. newlinechar  newlinechar At the very least, you'd need some kind of command/control/monitoring system outside of it - but perhaps we agree on this point.

They already contribute in taxes.  That's not the point, the growth is the problem.  We need to have sustainable growth.  Right now California is running out of water as is much of the southwest because we don't have enough water for the people that are already here.

&gt;It's a programming language designed to suit  newlinechar &gt;management. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually no.  There was a lot of academic and developer take-up of Java when it started, and with good reason. newlinechar  newlinechar I used to be a Smalltalk developer.  It was great, but then the versions (VisualWorks and VisualAge) that (at the time) had reasonable performance and cross-platform portability were priced out of my range.  I looked around for a development language that met my criteria: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Had garbage collection (after a decade of using C and C++, I never wanted to do manual memory management ever again) newlinechar 2. Was reasonably OOP. newlinechar 3. Was cross-platform (at the stage of deployment, not just for compiling) newlinechar 4. Did not cost too much. newlinechar 5. Was available from different vendors, so I did not have too much 'tie in'. newlinechar 6. Had reasonable performance. newlinechar 7. Was not horribly obscure, so my code could be passed on others, or I could easily build a team. newlinechar  newlinechar Commercial Smalltalks had matched these criteria, but failed 4 when they got to the stage of per-processor deployment charges that involved a percentage of company profits (I kid you not). newlinechar  newlinechar The fact is that Smalltalk attempted suicide in the mid-to-late 90s.  Fortunately, it did not quite succeed, but what was left did not suit my needs.  Java did, and it did for thousands of other developers at that time.  To say 'its a programming language designed to suit management' is just an easy and sloppy jibe.

Doesn't matter.

Hey Tony, newlinechar  newlinechar The only statement in the above that to my knowledge is not a direct paraphrase of something you've said is the space-time thing, which was more my interpretation of what you tried to say.

It's still not true. Not even within the non-rivalry sector (opensource). newlinechar  newlinechar In the OSS world the most succesfull software is not those which are brilliantly written, but those who are written with the KISS ideology. Because they allow more people to contribute. newlinechar  newlinechar Obviousbly, mediocre programmers are more likely to keep it simple, to keep it stupid.  newlinechar  newlinechar The thing is, the genius programmer isn't even using a language the rest of us is capable of using effectively.  newlinechar  newlinechar You seem to think that the quality of software has purely a quantative aspect. You can always just work longer and harder. Rewrite more often.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, geniusses write software for geniusses. They are likely to write very good sofware, but unlikely to write very succesfull software.  newlinechar  newlinechar From a purely rational point of view, sofware that is just more than once, should not be using a mouse. At all. It's not very productive. It can cause RSI. Yet mouse driven interface are more popular than ever. newlinechar  newlinechar Because people like mediocraty. They don't like effort.

The reason it's voted down (or was) is because, while the cdr of a dotted list is not a list, it is still the cdr and not a car.   'car' and 'cdr' are the first and second elements of a cons respectively.  In a normal list the car of each cons points to a value and the cdr of that cons either points to the next cons in the list, or, if the cons is the last in the list, the cdr is 'nil'.  In a dotted list (as this example shows) both  car and cdr point to values.  newlinechar here's an attempt at a visual example: newlinechar  newlinechar cons   [car][cdr] newlinechar  newlinechar (A B)  [A][--&gt;] [B][Nil] newlinechar  newlinechar (A .

Oh ya wouldn't doubt it.  I have many friends who see my Ron Paul t-shirt and say 'Who's that' or 'whats this Ron Paul thing?'  Gotta educate them, but once you introduce them to the man and the message they go on an internet frenzy searching him and they hop right on board.  Thats the problem with the older generation, even if you tell them who Ron Paul is and what he stands for, most of them don't know how to use a computer to look him up and find more information about him.  So the information quickly leaves their brain when they go back to the MSM and hear about how great Giuliani, Romney, and Huckabee are.

&gt;Whether government and corporations are intertwined is a completely separate issue from whether the government has any effect on the economy. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't see how you can even think such a thing. Especially since you did not elaborate in any way on how these two things are not the same. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It's often companies acting in their own self-interest that push for deregulation, that will allow themselves greater profits, without additional benefit for consumers. newlinechar  newlinechar Wrong again. Companies are pushed to create things that people will want to buy in successively greater numbers. Other companies, meanwhile, are pushed to compete with them. The driving force here is *efficiency*, and consumers have direct benefit because they can buy more for less. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Who benefits from a completely unregulated marketplace? Who suffers? newlinechar  newlinechar Companies benefit first by being free to seek profit in any way they want. The people benefit second by being offered a larger choice of products/services, at higher and higher quality and lower and lower prices through the forces of competition and natural selection. The only ones who suffer are corrupt politicians. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The best countries in the world to live in overwhelmingly follow social-democratic principles. newlinechar  newlinechar Quality of life is not always related to freedom. You've never read any science fiction books? There's a reason they all portray utopian dictatorship societies as BAD things, and people who rise up against the utopia to take back their freedom (even at the expense of lowering the quality of life) as heroes. The reason they are portrayed like that in fiction is because men have an innate desire to be free, even at the expense of personal well-being. Ask yourself: *Would you rather be free and poor, or rich and repressed?* newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This is an economic approach that has proven itself empirically. newlinechar  newlinechar Only because a fully libertarian approach has **never** been attempted (i.e. when the entire society is libertarian, not just one or two small segments of it). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Do you have evidence...  newlinechar  newlinechar There have, in fact, been *many* studies that conclude that libertarian theories would produce the most optimal results. Libertarianism does not exist in a vacuum. It is a thoroughly-researched topic. While I can't point you to any *one* piece of evidence, start on websites like mises.org and work your way up. Libertarian groups routinely publish findings and honest-to-goodness studies and research that support their beliefs.

I'm not going to give the common answers of 'those are crazy people', I believe that money and sex makes the world go around and can explain just about everything. Also, I accept that there are assassination in this day and age, so no argument here. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I agree with you, 'Cui bono?' is the right question to ask.  newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree, I think of the true question differently and I don't think you'll disagree.  newlinechar  newlinechar The rich already benefit from most things and they have most of the money and the power currently in the US. The rich have usually always been wealthy and much of the recent millionairs will likely lose their wealth just as quickly as they gained it. The real wealth and power will still be concentrated in the 1% that has always had the wealth. newlinechar  newlinechar So the current rich have their money and they have the true power to manipulate affairs within the world. So truly who benefits from 9/11 and a power grab? Definitely not the established rich people, they're already rich remember. So only a poor person with some power would orchestrate a plan like this. Not a 'poor' person in our terms, but poor compared to the established wealthy 1%. newlinechar  newlinechar So a conspiracy theory to grab power is grabbing it away from who? Is it grabbing it away not from the 99% of the world poor people? Someone didn't orchestrate 9/11 to steal power away from some hillbilly living in a trailer in Mississippi! They did this to steal power away from the wealthy 1% and the wealthy 1% wouldn't be likely to roll over and give it up easily. newlinechar  newlinechar So who are the possible choices for taking the power away from the rich? We have either Osama bin Laden, leading a poor ragtag element or some fat cat neocons put into power by the wealthy 1% to begin with. newlinechar  newlinechar So I counter all your arguments with the notion that the wealthy 1% already controlled everything before 9/11 and they had the neocons as their puppets. They in no way benefited from causing 9/11, they have lots of easier ways to manipulate things.

Most girls get fake boobies out of a lack of self-esteem, and or dissatisfaction with their bodies. Now wether that lack of self-esteem is brought by societies views and it's constant search for aesthetic beauty, thats a different story. You could tell a girl 'be happy with who you are, you look great' seven-hundred times... but you know what... In her mind... She's like... Fuck it! I'm getting big titties. newlinechar  newlinechar I for one am not a big titty man. I prefer girls with normal average size boobies but incredible asses. I just like that type of body proportions. But you know what... If she has big ass boobies... I don't discriminate, I appreciate. Other people (Ahem, Reddit) like the author moan and bitch about fake boobies... But then again... If the author drove around in a 1983 Toyota Corolla and all day everyday all he sees is Ferraris, Lamborginins, BMWs, Mercedes-Benz, and other high-end cars he would be bitching about... ENOUGH WITH THE HIGH-END PRICY CARS!!! newlinechar  newlinechar He's just bitchy and whiny because most likely... sub-consciously he wants some big ass titties in his face. But... He's married... So he's stuck with what he's got. So he has to side with what he's got. If his wife had fake boobies he would have never written the article and he would probably be enjoying them right now... Wait till your wife gets into her 40's and 50's bud... and her titties start going down down down... Let's see what your writing looks like then.
Upmodded because you make a semi point.  However, I don't carry pills around with me everywhere I go.  I just avoid going to places with dogs (dog shows, kennels, etc). Hence, why I don't have a dog as well.  My allergy to them is not severe as I'm lucky.  But it still exists.  Should I be on pills for the rest of my life on the off chance I'm going to be some where that a dog is going to show up? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the manager should be fired because it is the law.

&gt;Tobacco companies for years touted the health benefits of smoking. They were proven to be lying. They're still in business. newlinechar  newlinechar They're still in business because people still want to smoke, even knowing the negative consequences. Do you want to prevent people from hurting themselves? Do you want to outlaw drugs? Do you want to outlaw unhealthy diets? No more chocolate and sugar? Not more red meat? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The dairy industry today promotes misinformation regarding the health effects of its products, and happily gets away with it. newlinechar  newlinechar If there is any study that is published in the press claiming that dairy products are unhealthy, I promise you that the dairy industry's profits will suffer. What will they be forced to do then? Increase the quality of their products. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Companies sell magnetic bracelets, homeopathic remedies, chiropractic services, and numerous other completely discredited pseudo-medical products, and still make millions. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't see any problems with that. People are free to spend their money in any way that they wish. Education about these products is readily available, especially thanks to the internet, one of the most libertarian places you will *ever* encounter in our modern world. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The fact is, the average consumer lacks the education to make fully informed purchasing decisions. They aren't experts in medicine, nutrition, engineering, law, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar No, they're not experts, but being informed isn't that difficult. Countless private consumer-reporting organizations exist that review products, issue warnings, etc. What's wrong with people paying more attention to what they buy? They're spending their earnings on things -- they *should* pay attention. And if the government stops holding their hand as they walk blind through a dangerous world, they *will* pay attention. This is a good thing. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;What is reasonable for a community to do, is say 'We're being sold crap. Please hire some experts and evaluate products for safety and stop the worst from being sold.' newlinechar  newlinechar No. What is reasonable for a community to do, is say, 'We're being sold crap. Let's stop buying their products. We will gladly purchase a subscription to Consumer Reports for $20 a year, and in the future avoid buying bad products.' *That* is reasonable. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But by and large the results have shown themselves to be an improvement. newlinechar  newlinechar An improvement over what? The only libertarian society to ever exist in the world has been the internet. You can't compare the status quo to something that has never before been put into practice. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;What is the mindset that leads one to think a completely anarchic marketplace, where anything goes, is a good idea? newlinechar  newlinechar It is this mindset: newlinechar  newlinechar **'Any society that will give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both.' - Benjamin Franklin**

While working with the developers, it became immediately clear that the best way to discuss the **FSM**s with them was not to sit and look at the code implementing them, but to grab a sheet of paper and draw them. While it is true that the code implementing the **FSM** completely defines how that **FSM** behaves, looking at the code doesn't really give you an intuitive sense of what the **FSM** does.

I never heard that cheney was there, but I would imagine would step forward to say that  he gave them some unusual order. Besides that, he could have done whatever nefarious activities somewhere less obvious if he really was part of the plan. newlinechar  newlinechar The exercises themselves doesn't mean that 9/11 was an inside job, because these were regular exercises and not something out of the ordinary.

Really you would have to show that someone told the terrorist to attack that day, because it was the semiannual exercise period.

The bottom line is that if your self-esteem is entirely reliant on what other people or the media think, you'll never be happy.  Big breasts or not.  Once the novelty of the breasts wears off, they will just find something else to be unhappy about and most likely will go for more plastic surgery.

Sure, you could buy a lot more with a dollar in that era, but you would probably be very lucky to make $1,000 in a year. If goods are worth 14.2 times as much now, so is your labor. newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly, I'd rather have a relatively stable economy with inflation than try to permanently fix the value of the dollar to some meaningless amount.

Many lawyers get rich representing corporations; many lawyers get rich suing corporations ([such as John Edwards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edwards#Legal_career)).  According to the American Bar Association, there were [over 1,100,000 lawyers practicing in America in 2006 (pdf)](http://www.abanet.org/marketresearch/lawyer_demographics_2006.pdf) and in 2000, 74% worked in private practice (presumably some for corporations), 8% in private industry, and 1% in legal aid/public defense.  Maybe it's just me, but the increase in litigation seems related to the rise of corporate power in this country. newlinechar  newlinechar Edwards has achieved impassioned legal wins for injured people.  However his for-it-before-he-was-against-it record raises questions.

Dennis Kucinich doesn't have this problem--he voted against the PATRIOT Act, voted against the Iraq war, voted against funding the Iraq war, voted against unfair trade agreements.  When Kucinich changes his stance (such as shifting from pro-life to pro-choice), [he explains how he got there](http://www.ontheissues.org/2004/Dennis_Kucinich_Abortion.htm); when Edwards changes his stance, he pretends he's always thought that way and ignores when others call him on it.

This may sound racist but it was also when it was under white colonization. When it got overthrown, or rather voted out, Mugabe and his regime went insane and drove out absolutely every single white person. Farmers, academics, politicians, scientists - Gone. Then began the fall of his country because no one was equipped with knowledge on how to sustain their agricultural industries, stability and the economy. This is significantly in part due to the racist apartheid policies of the British though which led to having less black Zimbabweans educated on how to manage their country.

I honestly don't think it is. Gangs of kids beat people up all the time. I was attacked by five teenagers when I was 20 for no reason whatsoever. In [local news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7130555.stm) today a guy was sentenced for a random killing. Some people are just bastards.  newlinechar  newlinechar Just because victim and perp are different races it doesn't mean it was a hate crime. And I also believe that using racial slurs does not necessarily make it a hate crime. The sort of person who randomly starts a fight will use anything e.g. 'hey fatso' or 'hey ginger head' and so on. Anything that is slightly different will be seized upon but IMHO it's not a hate crime unless that was the driving factor in the attack.

&gt;Marriage provides a much stronger bond (even though there is divorce) than a simple verbal 'hey let's live together.' newlinechar  newlinechar But that bond is purely legal.  It's basically saying 'If you leave me, I'm permitted by law to take half of our stuff.'  It does nothing to increase or decrease the *actual* bond between the people involved.  They don't love one another more.  It's just an artificial construct by which the state can make it more difficult (and more painful) to break that bond. newlinechar  newlinechar So, from the point of view of raising children, marriage is, itself, of little value.  It's the strong bonds that tend to *result* in marriage that are beneficial.  As I mentioned before, marriage is an *effect* of good families, not a cause. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If there is a choice between being adopted by a single parent and a couple, I choose the couple (all else being equal). If the choice is between a same-sex couple and a married couple (all else equal) I choose the married couple. newlinechar  newlinechar In which case I fail to see how gay marriage is an issue at all.  The case workers assigned to handle this stuff are charged with doing what's in the best interest of the child.  Gay couples aren't suddenly going to start overwhelming straight couples in the adoption processes if they're allowed to marry. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, the fact is that not every child available to be adopted is actually adopted.  So even *if* gay marriage made it more likely that gay couples could adopt children, it would still mean that fewer children are being left in foster care, so it's a beneficial situation for the children.

&gt;Make anything dangerous like that a prescription only drug. You're still going to have people abusing it, but in far fewer numbers.

They shouldn't create them.  Here, take this.  It will make you sick.  That's not what prescription drugs should be. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There's tons of stuff one can take that can cause permanent harm. What about sniffing glue? Should we ban glue too because it can be abused? newlinechar  newlinechar Just like the prescription drugs, glue has another purpose other than getting people high.

&gt;Anyone suggesting that 'traditional marriage' has existed in its current form for all human history is either dishonest or profoundly ignorant of our history. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Traditional' marriage (since you seem to deny there is such thing) has always been man and woman.

Doing crack would be wrong even it were legal. newlinechar  newlinechar So frankly, I have no idea why you continue to attempt to muddy the waters with your blathering about legalities. newlinechar  newlinechar It is you that is ignorant if you think that marriage has been anything but man/woman (except for the Left-wing anthropologists that continue to try to magically create proof otherwise despite the massive evidence to the contrary) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If you do believe that gay marriage could endanger the survival of a civilization, I'd like to hear some kind of cause-and-effect explanation regarding how this could possibly happen. newlinechar  newlinechar I encourage you to read the explanations given on other responses to similar requests in this thread.

You're both missing the point. The back button is neither an undo button nor an edit button, it is a BACK button.

The underlying presumption is government knows better than the people.  Another way to say this is these 'progressives' feel they know what's best for the greater good.  This is Collectivism.  Socialism, Communism on the left, or Facism, Corporatism, and Dictatorships on the right, are all forms of Collectivism, which is the antithesis of Indivdualism, the basis of the Constitution('inaliable rights'.)  The indivdualist solution for this 'problem' would be that it's up to parents to monitor and filter their childrens internet access and instill their values.  Instead, here we have the collectivist 'solution' of killing off the internet for all for the 'greater good' of protecting the children.  It's why the only viable candidate I see is Ron Paul.

&gt; I doubt someone of your intellectual stature is writing from a library or university. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, obviously, insulting me lets everyone know your intellectual stature.

How am I supposed to have a conversation with someone that already hates and insults people that disagree before the conversation begins.  Glad to hear that university of yours has opened your mind. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, the gist of your argument is that you claim that marriage is correlated with positive outcomes in children, and so that the marriage *and* the positive outcomes are probably caused by underlying behaviors and traits in that couple. newlinechar  newlinechar So given that you repeated the same argument over and over from you moral pedestal in between your insulting remarks, I can boil my response down to a a few points: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Marriage is not a continuous variable; statistically you cannot correlate an either/or, only numerical values. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Children of divorce are worse off than those of a married couple.  You'll probably argue that those divorced parents were more likely to get divorced and not stay married, etc, but that is silly. newlinechar  newlinechar The onus is on you to prove your thesis, considering it is much more parsimonious and it would be quite odd to think that no researcher had accounted for that.

&gt;the one man/multiple women marriage would be common in more cultures. So it would actually be more accurate to refer to polygamy as 'traditional' marriage. The whole idea of marriage for romantic love by itself is pretty new.  newlinechar  newlinechar I never said anything about romantic love, and frankly, polygamy is still 'man/woman.'  Why is that so hard?  Do you insist on trying to muddy waters to fit your ideology?  Conceding that fact isn't going to kill you, sheesh. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Anyone whose facts don't jibe with your opinions must be 'left-wing', eh? It's ironic that you're always the first one to accuse someone of bias. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, I am familiar with the studies conducted trying to prove that there were gay marriages in medeival societies, and frankly, considering that 70-80% of Academics are left-leaning... my assumptions are not off-base. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I encourage you to take the time to make your own argument instead of being lazy about it. newlinechar  newlinechar I apologize - they are *my* responses on this thread.  I am the only one arguing against it here :). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Why is gay marriage wrong? newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly, barring religion, it boils down to this concept.  The more I think about it, this is the single issue for me: newlinechar  newlinechar It has everything to do with children and the role of marriage in *our* society.  It is not specifically anti-same-sex marriage, but more pro-preserving our current definition of marriage. newlinechar  newlinechar Marriage is the best situation to raise a child in.  Men and women are also different in a host of ways, so in an optimal situation (and considering the research), having a biological mother and father in a married relationship is the *best* situation for a child to be in.  That doesn't mean a same-sex couple is not 'second best' which I believe it is.  I am *more* adamantly against single parenthood and angry divorces and out-of-wedlock births, frankly, because of their destructive nature on children. newlinechar  newlinechar But the point remains: having a married mother and father is best.  Expanding the current definition of marriage (since you barred the use of 'traditional' even though it is valid) to include more and more 'situations' muddies the waters and expands the situations children can be placed in, creating a host of new situations that are inferior for them to be brought up in. newlinechar  newlinechar That's all, really, and so if same-sex advocates could admit that scientifically and philosophically a married opposite-sex couple is better for children, I think I'd be more inclined to be sympathetic.  When someone wants new rights, it takes a lot of gall to declare a lot of things untrue that are.

While i agree with you in theory, in reality i think there comes a point when you're better off cheating as well.

Agreed. Perl's design philosophy (and it *does* have one) is quite different to other languages. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it has been expressed well as 'Perl's learning curve isn't steep, but it is very long'. newlinechar  newlinechar i.e. You can be productive in perl quickly. But it also rewards deeper study. 'Easy things should be easy, difficult things should be possible'. newlinechar  newlinechar But this means it is possible for someone further up the learning curve to baffle a relative-beginner. Fortunately, the docs and community (perlmonks) are both very good.

Ok, I see you're a troll, should've known.  But I'll go ahead and comment.  I didn't say every urban poor person commits a crime, don't be purposely dense.  I said poor urban people commit crimes, and they do at a much higher rate than their rural counterparts, be they black white or whatever.  Cram people in a crowded, poor, urban environment with shitty schools and they will engage in a higher rate of criminal activity. You know a black kid that commits crimes and he's middle class?  Wonderful, would you like a cookie and a gold star for that ridiculous tripe of a troll statement. I know plenty of well off white kids that commit crimes.  You know what, one of the biggest criminals in the world-we all know of him--he's rich as fuck and he robs everyone except his pals and guess what, he's white, his name's bush, you wanker.

For example, if the kids had just finished a lesson on Rosa parks, and one of the kids had said, 'Let's go out and show those white folks how it feels when you can't sit where you want', and some other kids agreed, then went out and did it, I think that would qualify as a hate crime.

Seriously threatening to kill a specific person is against the law.  Praising killers is not.

You will only harden their belief.

 newlinechar The difference between atheism and religion is that as an atheist I am not claiming anything, except that which can be determined or measured objectively.   newlinechar  newlinechar Religions, on the other hand, make many claims about the way thing are, and they do not back those claims up with evidence, which means that, at best, all of the claims of said religions are guesses.

I think that's where my agreement ends though. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Claiming this stuff has nothing to do with religion makes as much sense as claiming evolution is just a theory. newlinechar  newlinechar Evolution *is* just a theory.  No scientist, anywhere, would claim it as fact, at least not in those exact words.  There is no *proof* of evolution, just an extreme amount of evidence.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There is a theory that religion is the culprit, and it is confirmed by millions of experiments. This makes it a scientific fact. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, there's really no such thing as scientific fact, and as far as those experiments go, I'm genuinely interested in hearing about them.  That kind of thing fascinates me, but being that I have a fair background in Psych and I haven't ever heard of one of those experiments, I have my doubts.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Btw, 'atheism' does not necessarily mean the opposite of such a belief system. In my life I've had enough of Marxism-Leninism which in Soviet interpretation became a bona fide religion exactly of the kind I hate. newlinechar  newlinechar Not sure what you mean there.  Could you elaborate a little? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Being tolerant to these religions is dangerous. I can turn my other cheek and you can, but for society it means disaster.  newlinechar  newlinechar Tolerance and turning the other cheek are two different things.  To be tolerant is to respect, to turn the other cheek is to ignore.  You can respect someone elses opinion while still trying to educate them about yours, especially if you have evidence to back yours up.  But the rest of that paragraph really *was* an overgeneralization and hyperbole ;) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I wouldn't call myself an atheist, though I'm also not an agnostic in the popular meaning of 'bible could be right'. I don't believe a deity could exist, but even if I would admit the possibility, I would never accept the worship-me fag-hating deity. I see where this stuff is coming from and it is not Heavens. newlinechar  newlinechar Exactly the same as myself =)

&gt;My point is that a legal conviction does not make a religion a 'cult' or unworthy of respect newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Just because the founder of a religion was a con artist or a murderer doesn't mean the religion is bad. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Who cares if Joseph Smith was a convicted fraudster who specialized in mixing up fake archaeology and religion?  Who cares if he took many wives including 14 year old girls and women who already had husbands?  And who can fault him for gaining political power and trying to become President by exploiting people who thought he was God's earthly messenger?  It doesn't mean his religion is made up!

Oh yes, property() is unquestionably a good thing.  Encapsulation is a good thing, too, and I hope it didn't sound like I didn't think so.  I was just trying to say encapsulation, which is absolutely a good thing, doesn't necessarily mean compiler-enforced access rules, which I think are mostly superfluous. newlinechar  newlinechar After posting my comment above, I was trying to think of what compiler-enforced encapsulation could be good for, and I suppose it could guard against accidentally stomping on a private member.  There are doubtless other good cases to be made.   newlinechar  newlinechar But I was so surprised by how little compiler-enforced access rules mattered, after totally drinking the kool-aid about how  it was *essential* to good OO programming.  It's weird when you completely buy that something is an absolute necessity, and you dutifully follows the rules to the tee, and then realize that you can just completely chuck the whole darn business.

It's utter bullshit to think that these 'subprime' borrowers thought they could actually afford the houses they were picking up.  Everyone I know who used one of these mortgages was living in a Speculative dreamworld where house prices NEVER came down.  I personally know 2 people who have purchased multiple homes hoping to get rich.  They used ARMs to leverage as much of their assets as possible into real estate.  Meanwhile, I thought these people were crazy -- prices were completely unsupportable if looking at the fundamentals (such as local salaries).  If the government decides to bail out these folks, then I will be screwed twice: the market will not adjust, so I'll never be able to afford to buy my own home, and as a taxpayer I'll be on the hook for paying for the bailout.  Now, tell me, if I went to Las Vegas and gambled away a bunch of money on borrowed credit, would you be happy if the government made you pay my gambling debt?  Because that's EXACTLY what I think the government is asking taxpayers to do -- Pay for the speculative gamble of subprime borrowers.
Certainly not.  I think different factions are made up of different *proportions* of sensible or deluded people, or nice people or jerks, but every faction and philosophy has each of them. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, I've even known some dogmatic and intolerant people who characterised themselves as *Buddhists*, and I've known plenty of very nice Muslims and Christians. newlinechar  newlinechar Equally, I've met some really retarded and dogmatic fellow-atheists... newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, *any* club will attract a mix of people.  There are those who understand the teachings and want to open dialogue with or persuade others, and there are those who only join a club so they have a ready-made group of other people to look down on and demonise. newlinechar  newlinechar Rejoice, people of different races, creeds and philosophies!  We are united by the fact we all have fuckwits making us look bad to everyone else.

Languages inherently 'enforce,' in the sense of make it easy to program in, a certain style.  Python is about every solution being clean and easy to understand.  It's philosophy is that there's only one way to do something, the opposite of Perl's and Ruby's. newlinechar  newlinechar Take a look at other languages.  C and C++ are both about speed.  LISP is about modifying the language for the domain of the problem.  Java is about being explicit about *everything*. newlinechar  newlinechar You can program in different ways, but then again, if possible, you could just program in a different language that matches your style. newlinechar  newlinechar Even Matz agreed that the perfect Guido von Rossum would probably be Python.

Once again, you're assuming that the populous has any meaningful power in society.  They have *none*.

Because apparently that is not the case; apparently he served.  But without bothering to do the slightest fact checking, the Marine, and apparently many others, assumed that Brad DeFlumeri was simply another Republican chickenhawk, and that does not appear to have been the case with DeFlumeri.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are a lot of good arguments against the war, and there are a lot of times when calling a chickenhawk a chickenhawk is the right and proper thing to do.

I read a book on interview and interrogation techniques which suggested that even normal verbal interview techniques may appear to juries as tricking or harassing a suspect into a confession; showing a video of the interview in court even to prove that nothing untoward took place could bias a jury against the prosecution. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm still not sure how I feel about that line of reasoning, but with 'enhanced interrogation' now a reality in America, I agree that every move and sound an LEO makes in the presence of a suspect needs to be recorded for the public.

&gt;People that make the choice to make that extra commitment are more likely, though I can't speak for anyone, to have 'more love' for each other newlinechar  newlinechar Which is exactly what I've been saying!  Pay careful attention to the wording you just used.  People who choose to get married are likely to have 'more love' for each other.  The 'more love' isn't the result of the marriage.  The marriage is the result of the 'more love'.  Marriage is a *result* of good relationships, not the cause. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If it wasn't so important, why are people arguing for same-sex marriage inclusion!? newlinechar  newlinechar I wouldn't argue that it isn't important in a broader sense.  It grants specific legal rights, and is one method that gives an easy way to describe a monogamous relationship. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But what if there are two equal couples - one same-sex and one married opposite-sex? Would you give preference? newlinechar  newlinechar Nope.  I also wouldn't give preference to couples over single parents.  Everything should be handled on a case-by-case basis. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;if not, why not, considering both the research and the logical fact that a man and woman are different... newlinechar  newlinechar I don't need research to tell me that.  However, not having a parent of one particular sex doesn't rule out having role model of that sex.  Aunts, uncles, family friends, etc.  That is something that the case worker would take into consideration.  I would never preclude someone from adopting based *solely* on their orientation, though.

I never said you should.  If you like Lisp (or whatever), use it.  If you don't, don't.  I like Lisp and Perl and use them.  I don't like C++ and don't use it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar One the other hand I learned quite a lot of C++ and used it on the job for about 2 years.  How much Lisp do you know? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My point is (kind of) that the existence of your question proves my (our?  (mine and Larry's)) point.  Lots of people consider Lisp unsuitable for them, at least in part because of the popular view of Lisp as a language 'not for mere mortals'.  A lot of Lispers, since they know Lisp, must ergo not be 'mere mortals' (in their own minds), and revel in it.  A lot of people try to puncture that Smug Lisp Weenie attitude.  The whole interaction has been going on for a while, and Larry's remark summarizes it pretty well, I think. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In reality, you can ignore a lot of the corners of Lisp and do some very interesting work.  If you have a good implementation you can do some serious system interaction.  And comp.lang.lisp is a pretty friendly forum, in my experience.  So I, for one, do not consider Lisp a language 'not for mere mortals', having learned about it in my teens and written an interpreter for it, but I will grant you that most Lisp implementations do not cater to (that is, do not bend over backwards to conform to) the (often unconscious) preconceived notions of people coming to it from C or Java or the like.

The dominant frames on reddit tend to be libertarian and liberal (in a global context - I understand the American political mainstream is quite narrow and skewed to the right), but the community in general seems to be willing to correct its own errors.  newlinechar  newlinechar Hence, after the outpouring of panic yesterday about the new internet legislation, this post comes along to dispel the panic and provide better context.

Actually, the manner in which our drug policy kills is not yet incineration, but the fact is that our drug policy does kill.  And in great numbers. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider all of those who are denied medicine they and their doctors say is vital to their recovery. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider all of the research that has been terminated and results censored that might have yielded cures for some of our most deadly diseases. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider all of the HIV/AIDS and other diseases that are spread by intravenous drug use only because our drug policy forbids people access to clean needles. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider the fact too that our drug policy actually promotes the most deadly and addictive drugs, alcohol and tobacco, while using violence to deter the use of far safer and less addictive drugs, like marijuana and ecstasy. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider the wars we fight.  Both overseas, as in Colombia or Afghanistan, or here at home on our streets, all because of our drug policy. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider the people we allow to remain in power by virtue alone of the way our drug policy enriches them.  An especially disturbing case of this happened recently in Burma/Myanmar.  Look at how many people they killed. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider all of the non-violent drug offenders we lock up in prison, lock up with violent felons, and who are then beaten and raped and contract HIV/AIDS and then when released go on to spread it to others. newlinechar  newlinechar It's hard to add all these numbers up.  No way we can do an exact count. newlinechar  newlinechar But we can know and understand the scale of this atrocity.  We many not know how many tens or even hundreds of millions have died as a result of our drug policy, not just here at home but as exported around the world by virtue of our economic and military might, but we can know that it is in the tens or even hundreds of millions. newlinechar  newlinechar An atrocity without equal.

That's a great point. It really depends on how much the religion affects the person. If the religion starts affecting every action and influencing their presidency to an extreme degree, I'd be against it. newlinechar  newlinechar Take Mitt Romney for example. If the prophet says something that's against what's in best interest of the nation, and Romney decides to follow the prophet because of his religion, than he is a fool. He might be a hell of a believer and good for him for following his religion so closely, but he is definitely not a great president if he puts the interests of his religion in front of the interests of the nation.

&gt; You cannot look at war as a popularity contest newlinechar  newlinechar You are refuting your own argument of a popular vote on the war. And I agree once again, when the media is pro war it is not hard to mobilize the masses. newlinechar  newlinechar You know how 1939 Poland was such a thread to Germany and how they attacked first in Gleiwitz? Every German knew the war was justified. Like Herrmann Goering said : 'Naturally the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. ...Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Each U.S. state has its own statute which dictates how much interest can be charged before it is considered usurious or unlawful. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If a lender charges above the lawful interest rate, a court will not allow the lender to sue to recover the debt because the interest rate was illegal anyway.

Ref NY Gen Oblig 5-501 et seq. and NY 1503. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;However, there are separate rules applied to most banks. In 1980, due to inflation, national banks (banks that generally include N.A. in their name), federally chartered savings banks, installment plan sellers and chartered loan companies were exempted from state usury limits by the federal government through a special law.

just in case it's ripped: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar BRAND NEW Guitar Hero III Legends of Rock for the Nintendo Wii Game System newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar In Box Never Opened, just bought it a few days ago I will give you the receipt (shown in picture)! newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar Here’s the deal: newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar So I spent who knows how many hours of my life trying to get “Guitar Hero 3” for the Nintendo Wii for my 15 year old son who has been begging for it since he was born (well not really but he’s wanted it for awhile). So after waiting in lines and going into every game store in the city over the last 2 weeks (practically being laughed at when I asked for guitar hero 3) I finally got lucky and got one at EB Games (they just got a shipment of them 25 minutes before I walked in!). newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar So I was so relieved in that I had finally got the Holy Grail of Xmas presents pretty much just in the nick of time. I couldn’t wait to spread the jubilance to my son. newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar Then, yesterday, I came home from work early and what to I find? My innocent little boy smoking pot in the backyard with 2 of his delinquent friends. newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar Now I know santa applies the “naughty or nice” paradigm to determine who gets what on Christmas. My son (Isaac) hasn’t exactly been Mother Teresa this year (he got suspended for fighting in the spring, among other things) but I thought I could still justify getting him this present. Maybe it would make him stay home more and “rock out” on this fake guitar thing. He pretty much spends all his free time at his friend’s house playing it anyways (while high on marijuana, I would imagine). newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, I am now finding it hard to justify rewarding him with this gift after he so greatly disappointed me. I know smoking a joint isn’t the end of the world, but if you can convince me that he deserves the gift, then I will end the auction. You will have to be very convincing. I am an elementary school teacher and I know that rewarding bad behavior is just asking for more of the same… newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar After I caught him getting high on my patio I did the typical yelling, screaming, kicking out the friends, etc… but I had not decided on a suitable way to punish him.

Not true.  Hong Kong speaks Cantonese, which is a regional dialect spoken in the surrounding provinces, reaching all the way to Taiwan.  It is such a popular dialect that when the Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, they had to make a conscientious decision to make Mandarin the official dialect because Cantonese was also a very popular dialect for the island. newlinechar  newlinechar And on the broader scale, most Chinese speak some dialects other than Mandarin; Mandarin is just the Beijing dialect that the Communist chose to standardize as the national dialect.  Most of their national figures speak Mandarin with an accent, if not a heavy accent.  Chairman Mao and Deng Xiaoping are two of those whose accents were very thick.  And in that context, people in Hong Kong also speak Mandarin, also with a heavy accent. newlinechar  newlinechar I know this because I spent 19 years in Hong Kong and various parts of China.  I also speak Mandarin, with a better accent than some of the locals in Hong Kong. :)

Penn's opinion of the films is only that, his opinion.  He didn't give a considered appraisal of their aesthetic value, just called films about hobbits shit.  Well that's not intelligent criticism, just the opinion of an ahole.  Penn shouts as if this gives his opinions more authority.  His feigned anger is as lame as Bill O'Reilly's.  Redditors like Penn's schtick more because his sentiments are closer to their own.  Penn generally goes after the low hanging fruit: bottled water is expensive and foolish (gee, really?), polling can be an instrument of propaganda(he figured this out in 2007?), gun control laws mostly work against those who respect the law (damn, next he'll discover that criminals are lawbreakers)... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong, we do live in times when the restatement of the obvious may be the first duty of intelligent men (Orwell), but Penn's rants take far too long to say far too little.  A more interesting approach wouldn't be to conclude 'Fuck you Frank' because then one simply resorts to rejecting polls categorically, a fool's position.

&gt; It already is that, like it or not. newlinechar  newlinechar Not so much in the FDA world.  There's a pretty rigorous process to get drugs qualified for sale in this country, and while there are some problems (vioxx), it's generally regarded that the FDA knows their stuff and things that the FDA says will treat a condition do so safely. newlinechar  newlinechar The difference between having an FDA and a 'free market' FDA is that the free market FDA would have to make a profit, meaning that not only does it have to cover its own costs, but has to provide its owners with cash, or else noone will want to do that.  The alternative is that the prices are so high that not everyone opts for such a process and their products are not necessarily safe, much like UL is today. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The reason you need this sort of 'consumer safety' has nothing to do with wanting to help people. newlinechar  newlinechar No, it has to do with the fact that I need to put my trust somewhere, and I'm not about to go all 'free market' when it comes to my health.  When my doctor prescribes something to cure my daughter's ear infection, I trust that he knows what he's doing and that what he prescribed went through as much testing as possible to make sure that it's not only safe, but also does the job it's supposed to do. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; That's why if a few dozen people die because of an e. coli outbreak, or a kitchen appliance explodes and kills 10 children, nothing substantial changes. newlinechar  newlinechar Aside from the FDA and CDC coming out with rules on how to properly handle and cook meat, you mean? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This is obvious to me, why isn't it obvious to you? newlinechar  newlinechar You live in some parallel utopia where all customers are smart and all companies put their customers ahead of a buck.  I wish the world were that way, but it's not.

Wow, OK, you know what?  I thought you were coming at this from the other angle... newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with your first point, in part.

Polls are generally very *reliable*.

Well thanks for the discussion.  A few final points on my end, and I'll give you the last word: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Thank you for not resorting to personal attacks.  I get voted down, obviously, but you haven't been screaming bigot at me like so many others on this thread do, and I appreciate having a discussion with someone that actually listens to opposing points of view without labeling them first. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) I understand the argument that marriage is the *result* of a committed relationship, but I ask this question:  If an option to publicly label one's committed relationship is removed, will that not damage relationships because they have no way of taking that extra step?  In my mind, marriage is not a label, but an extra step.  If it weren't, than the piece of paper wouldn't mean anything and committed non-married couples would be the same as married couples statistically. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Nope. I also wouldn't give preference to couples over single parents. Everything should be handled on a case-by-case basis. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) There are obviously some situations where a single parent would be better than a couple of some sort.  Making same-sex marriage legal and on the same plane as opposite-sex marriage takes away the ability of adoption agencies to choose a married, opposite-sex couple over same-sex all things being equal, even given that scientifically a married opposite-sex couple is best *and* a child would have access to a mother *and* a father in one, and two of one (and therefor not getting the benefits of the inherent natural differences in the sexes) in the other. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;However, not having a parent of one particular sex doesn't rule out having role model of that sex. Aunts, uncles, family friends, etc. That is something that the case worker would take into consideration. newlinechar  newlinechar 4) Role models are great, and they are needed.  But that is not the same as a mother or father, and it never will be obviously. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I would never preclude someone from adopting based solely on their orientation, though. newlinechar  newlinechar 5) I never would either.  It has everything to do with selecting the best situation for a child that is presently available to the child. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks again for the post.  Hopefully some of the others on this thread can learn from you style of discussion and having a rational discourse.
Ordinarily I'd say 'not programming', but near the bottom of the first page is this quote: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Intensive-care medicine has become the art of managing  newlinechar &gt; extreme complexity—and a test of whether such  newlinechar &gt; complexity can, in fact, be humanly mastered. newlinechar  newlinechar This is the central problem of software, so I've put the rest of the 8-page article on the reading stack and voted it up.
So we suffer through 4-8 years of Hilliary and wait until things get so bad (changed from today's conditions) to get a majority vote. newlinechar  newlinechar That incredible thing will be that a vote for any other republican is a statement that things aren't so bad currently.

&gt; There is a disconnect there. newlinechar  newlinechar Brainfart/typo. Read it as 'than'. Customers that don't die buy again. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; But the cost of getting it approved by a free-market company will be lower? newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, I would expect so. And unapproved drugs could still be available, as a last resort. newlinechar  newlinechar Really, is this so hard to believe? We laugh when 60 Minutes does an expose on $1000 hammers and accept it as a given, but then we talk about the FDA and it's an automatic assumption that they're giving us the best possible service for the lowest price? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Approved by whom? My contention is that the FDA is doing a perfectly fine job right now. newlinechar  newlinechar No, they're doing a barely adequate job, at best, and plenty would argue that they're not even doing that. They receive an incredible amount of criticism even from those wanting to keep it, and have done so for decades. newlinechar  newlinechar And it misses the point. Doctors are already approved to weed out the quacks, and are probably the largest piece in a better filter for these things. Coupled with a UL-like private testing firm, or even better with several, there's no real need for an FDA. 
&gt;But the whole point of my post was that the article couldn't be reduced to an ad hominem attack as you clearly claimed in the post I was replying to.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You're kidding, right?  I just reread your post.  You posted SEVEN paragraphs regurgitating the argument from the website, and then mentioned 'ad hominem' once, in a single sentence, right at the end. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If your purpose was actually addressing the ad hominem matter, you did a spectacularly poor job of it.  It sure seemed to me that you just wanted to repeat the website's arguments - and then looked around for some way to tie what you'd just written in to something I said. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But, it doesn't matter.  Clearly the tide is against me in this debate.

Very strange.

First, I see you're also suffering of Google's bug with line spacing getting screwed up after a list. newlinechar  newlinechar I also want to correct you on two points: First, Microsoft has many cash cows, not just Windows and Office (somehow a very popular myth). Second, the reason this PC was so affordable wasn't the savings on software (OEM Windows is cheap, less than $50) but the crappy hardware. newlinechar  newlinechar I support your prediction that Linux will gain market share, but for a different reason: it simply has gotten better in recent years.

Basically, he moves the blocks by pivoting them on a small stone and using a lever to walk the block a little at a time.  The block is raised in a teeter-totter like fashion where a board is placed under the fulcrum, and then weight is added on one side creating a small gap under the fulcrum in which another board can be placed.  The weight is then transferred to the other end of the block and the process is repeated. 
We wouldn't be producing as much corn and the market would determine the best crop for each farm instead of the government.  It would also allow other nations like Mexico to compete on an equal basis.  The price of food may go up slightly but it would be cheaper for everyone as we wouldn't have to pay the subsidy and the place best suited to grow food would have the financial incentive to grow it.

The Greek cult of Dionysus had a Eucharist of bread and wine. newlinechar  newlinechar Since I am a recovering Catholic and never attended any non-Catholic religious ceremony, I have this question. Do non-Catholic Christians like Protestants or the para-Christian cults like Pentecostals have a form of Eucharist? How about confession?
A lot of us like guitar hero because it's a strong gateway drug to introduce our girlfriends to gaming. My girl went from GH3 to Time Crisis 4 to Uncharted.   newlinechar  newlinechar Further, I enjoy the game because I know I'm not going to learn guitar (I'd rather be learning Struts 2 or reading some book on Ajax or something); so I can rock out for a few hours when I'm in the mood.   newlinechar  newlinechar Personally - double worth it.
&gt; In the end, IP is an assault on free speech and that makes it totally immoral. newlinechar  newlinechar So free speech means that if you hear/see it, it's free, and therefore you are entitled to use that information however you wish?

Yes, that's the first thing that came to mind in 2001 for me. I wonder why the security isn't applied there at the pilot's cabin, rather than at the customer turnstile. It seems far more possible to achieve security at this small place. To prevent hijacking of airplanes, you could use biometrics, or some other way to lock and secure that door. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, there should be designs in airplanes to account for the possibility that the worst will happen - the plane will fracture and a wing will fall off. This happens periodically, just because of a plane's age, and fragility. The original meaning of 'Murphy's law' says that you should account for these kinds of disasters happening - not hope that they just simply won't.
&gt;Belief has nothing to do with it. If a actress doesn't believe in showing her nude body on film then she is unqualified to do nude scenes. Does that mean she should sue the film company for not hiring her do nude scenes? After all they are discriminating against her for her beliefs. newlinechar  newlinechar This is not a fair analogy.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You can't offer spirtual guidance based on the bible if you don't believe in the bible and you cannot do evolutionary research if you discount evolution. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, you can.  I know at least one atheist pastor who is doing his job even though he doesn't believe himself.  He doesn't make that known to the congregation, but he does his job anyways. newlinechar  newlinechar He can speak on his research from an evolutionary perspective (he was willing to discuss it as a theory, see page 2), so he certainly could still do the research. newlinechar  newlinechar But he was fired *before* that based on the fact he didn't believe in Evolution. newlinechar  newlinechar That is clearly quoted here: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'My supervisor and I had a follow up meeting during which my supervisor informed me that *if I do not believe in evolution, then he was paying me for only 7 to 10 percent of the work* I was doing under the grant.' newlinechar  newlinechar [emphasis added]

I do think they can.  I think votes are decided on for a complex number of factors.  I mean let's be honest.  Ron Paul supporters are trying to influence the vote (why should seeing a blimp with a candidate's name on it make them more qualified? But that's the goal - to convince people who see it to vote for Ron Paul).  There are many influences in the world.  I'm not sure what your point is or how this is undemocratic.
Depends on where you ride your bike.
I don't think anyone is arguing that the Bible is archaeologically perfect while the Book of Mormon isn't.   newlinechar  newlinechar I think the issue for most people is that while the Bible presents at least a somewhat plausible story of history if you strip out the magic stuff (and your quotes even say many archaeologists felt that it had a kernel of truth in it), the story of the Book of Mormon is crazy on its face.  It's not plausible at all.  You don't even wonder whether it has a kernel of truth because anyone reading it can instantly see it doesn't.  Jews establishing an empire in South America?  Native Americans being their descendants?   newlinechar  newlinechar The best thing the 'established' religions have is their age.  They're so old that their claims are cloaked by time and so they can fall back on that uncertainty when the craziness is pointed out.  The problem young religions like Mormonism face is that their craziness is right out in the open because they haven't had thousands of years to obfuscate it.

&gt;Rainbow tables are brute force by definition, and can't be practically used to crack passwords of sufficient length and complexity, or even properly salted passwords. newlinechar  newlinechar Utter bullshit.  Rainbow tables run on a linear order.  O(n).  It's not a brute force attack; it's a dictionary attack.  The brute force method runs on O(n^x) where x is the length of your password, and n is the number of possible keys.  If you do the same thing with NP problems, then you must admit that P=NP, and your CS prof only told you differently so you would waste your time on things you won't figure out. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And you do realize that 'It may take you a long time, perhaps forever to write that equation or formula, but it would compute very quickly' is very nearly the definition of NP? newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, I do realize that.  But, if you do write it, and it computes very quickly, then P=NP.  So, again, I realize that I am correct. newlinechar  newlinechar The only reason that the millennium problems are not solved, if they truly are not solved, is because people are not working on them.  I wouldn't be surprised if some large corporations have solved them, and are not collecting the prize, because a monopoly on the knowledge is much more valuable.
If this is the case, then you should be especially careful. Maybe only 5% bother to submit, and if they stop, the only ones left submitting will be literal spammers. Whether they're dumb for taking it personal or not, discouraging them is a bad idea. newlinechar  newlinechar If I'm not mistaken though, people who submit stories that are downmodded lose karma, and subsequent submissions get an even lower placement. So excessive downmodding may keep even their new stuff buried, even if it has improved. Even if they're thick-skinned enough to not take it personally.
We can thank Clinton for starting the trend by perjuring himself. newlinechar  newlinechar THANK YOU BILL!!
It covers logic programming.  The first few chapters cover the basics of pure logic programming, which consists of establishing constraint relationships, and then evaluating the tree using a unification algorithm instead of the standard eval/apply loop.  Then the book gets more Prolog specific, but still general, detailing common algorithms, the plusses and minuses of depth first/breadth first unification and occurs checks, and analyzing complexity of logic programs. newlinechar  newlinechar I highly recommend the book, if only to get your mind around the unification based evaluation model, which is very useful for algorithms like typechecking or general graph traversal.

If the politics of the process won't allow him to win a nomination, he's not going to win as a 3rd party either. The futility of the efforts to fight the MSM have really become obvious to me over the past month. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem really is a lack of civic knowledge  by the population. There can be some very enlightened debate on reddit about the issues, but it really means zero outside the internet chat rooms. People still have no idea how government is supposed to work and they consider his ideas 'wacko'. newlinechar  newlinechar So in the end, its too hard to try and get his name out to the public, let alone educate them on the idea of checks and balances. The first primary will make or break the entire effort and listening to the Iowa citizens discuss politics is simply amazing. Waving a ron paul sign in their faces isn't going to change their ignorance.

Its amazing how much money other candidates will waste on having their 'entourage' follow them. Ron Paul doesn't seem to waste money, he needs no entourage, he doesn't need a whole army of campaign advisors and assistants. He tells it like it is, straight from his mind and heart. This is the first true American I've seen in a long time.
It's true that there are a good number of overzealous Ron Paul supporters.  However, can't that be said about any candidate?   newlinechar  newlinechar From my experience, a lot of Ron Paul supporters are extremely well informed.  Many others were not prior to learning about Paul, but are now making the effort to familiarize themselves with the issues and become informed. newlinechar  newlinechar This seems to me to be more common in the Ron Paul camp than in that of any other candidate.  For instance, have you ever heard a Thompson or Guiliani supporter give a solid reason on why they support their candidate?
Vote third party and wait for the revolution.

That is true but Microsoft doesn't really have a reputation for doing it like Apple does. newlinechar  newlinechar There are so many iPod, MacBook and other products of Apple's which have had problems and Apple just ignored it and blamed the user for months than finally caved and took responsibility. newlinechar  newlinechar Microsoft? I'm sure they've done it before, I can't really think of any examples though, and hell, most other large companies have probably done it at some point -- just none like Apple.

The problem isn't defined by the solution.  You believe what you say so much, that you say the solution I've shown you is impossible, only because you know P!=NP.  Rainbow table look-ups are a fast way of solving the password cracking problem.  It's a linear solution to what used to be an exponential problem.  The problems cracking the passwords.  Rainbow tables changes the order of cracking passwords.  You are saying it's a different problem?  You can down mod me day and night, but I think it's a mistake to define the problem by the solution. newlinechar  newlinechar But, the execution is what beings compared in an P and NP comparison.  We are not measuring the order that the developer runs on. LMAO!

Firsty, it is unavoidable that sometimes the result is outside of the margin of error. Even in the abstract 'ideal' case. 95% confidence means that it is espected that in 5% of the cases the result falls outside the bounds. With so many polls, your statement therefore is not true. Simple statistics. And reality is quite far removed from 'ideal'. newlinechar  newlinechar Second, saying something is quite different from doing it. The mindset is different. The context is different. There is always human interaction, so socially preferable choices come into play. All kinds of biases need to be filtered out, so you get a model that's used to 'process' the raw data, which is a hit-and-miss procedure. newlinechar  newlinechar All the attention that is going to the multitude of polls in the US, widely varying in quality and often distorted in the reporting, is wasted in my opinion. Better have meaningful discussion about real problems lying ahead. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm from Europe, and even the best available the polls I see here (Germany, France, UK, Holland) are not reliable.
&gt;Any poll that wants to be taken seriously will say it's sample size, sample methods and the exact questions asked. newlinechar  newlinechar And 99% of people will still have no idea whether the poll is trustworthy.
There is still one use for `apply`: newlinechar  newlinechar     @apply newlinechar     def f(): newlinechar         #setting up MyClass using different inputs or whatever newlinechar         return MyClass() newlinechar  newlinechar After this, `f` will be equal to the `MyClass` instance. Not hugely useful, and actually it probably makes the code harder to understand, and it doesn't even really save any lines of code, but it's something you can do that might be handy under certain circumstances. 
it's a conductive idea, but popular culture has been insulated from it

Sorry, no, at least not in my mind.  I don't think you can know what Deng was trying.

&gt;Abraham said he told Hahn he would do extra work to compensate and 'was willing to discuss evolution as a theory.' newlinechar  newlinechar Because he didn't believe in Evolution doesn't mean he can't discuss his research from that perspective as he was asked.  I could discuss astronomy from a Greek Mythological perspective even though I don't believe in Zeus. newlinechar  newlinechar The key is this: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'My supervisor and I had a follow up meeting during which my supervisor informed me that *if I do not believe in evolution, then he was paying me for only 7 to 10 percent of the work* I was doing under the grant.' newlinechar  newlinechar [emphasis added] newlinechar  newlinechar He was going to get a massive pay cut because he didn't believe in evolution, not because he didn't do the work.
Oh, any employer will say anything when the lawyers come calling. Between an employer and a terminated employee (even a creationist one), I'll believe the employee. newlinechar  newlinechar My bet: Woods Hole fired him because he had the gall to be different and still get the job done.
I disagree. I think if popular, underdog candidates form both parties teamed up, it would send a very powerful message. The libertarian party is as always already on all of the state ballots. That vehicle is ready to ride if we need it. A third party win would break the system. newlinechar  newlinechar This isn't about educated people, you see. We lost that civic minded attitude a long time ago. This is about people who are good and fed up with the status quo and want to send a message. This is about angry, disillusioned, or disappointed voters. More than half the country doesn't vote, so that's the total majority. Convince them they can TKO the system that's been pissing them off and you'll get some votes.
I think what Rails really got right is that it took a bunch of 'good things', bound them up together, did it in a relatively disciplined way, and used a pleasant language.  That might not sound like much, but compared to some of the PHP spaghetti messes around, or the java/xml drudgeries elsewhere, it was a huge improvement. newlinechar  newlinechar These days, a lot of people are imitating it, so you could probably get something about as good in a language you already know.
I don't know why you were downmodded; this is actually an excellent idea. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT:  basic weaponry probably isn't necessary, and is actually counter-productive in terms of safety.

Exactly.  And you have to recall that most of the founding fathers were Deists.  To them the 'Creator' was not very specific.

I would upmod it twice: once for RP and once for the parable. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you like that sort of story, perhaps this is another you will appreciate: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Once two monks on a pilgrimage came to the ford of a river.  There they saw a girl dressed in all her finery, obviously not knowing what to do since the river was high and she did not want to spoil her clothes.  Without more ado, one of the monks took her on his back, carried her across and put her down on dry ground on the other side. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Then the monks continued on their way. But the other monk after an hour started complaining, 'Surely it is not right to touch a woman; it is against the commandments to have close contact with women. How could you go against the rules for monks'  The monk who had carried the girl walked along silently, but finally he remarked, 'I set her down by the river an hour ago, why are you still carrying her?' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I know several stories like that and I find them to be applicable to life's situations over and over.

Yes, it is. It is much too far-fetched. No mainstream religion is anywhere near the same league as Scientology. Claiming otherwise only lends credibility to Scientology.
&gt;note: I'm from Canada so maybe the prices/quality aren't the same where you live newlinechar  newlinechar I'm from butt-fuck-egypt, so to speak, so you're probably right. newlinechar  newlinechar There's also the fact that Marijuana, even in huge doses, never affected me very much (many 'relaxant' type drugs, like most sleep medication and certain muscle relaxants, or the painkillers you get when they take your wisdom teeth out, also have little to no effect on me), so that probably plays into it as well.  Marijuana was like a ridiculously strong nicotine buzz, without the stomach sickness.

Wrong. How about how hypocritical of the media? They back whoever they think will get them advertising revenue and eyeballs in front of screens. I for one, still detest the mainstream media, because they are clearly just pandering for attention. Let's hear news regarding what our government is doing to us, and to people around the world. Let's see real and open debates, not the meaningless pap that they push on us. Let's see interview after interview with Sibel Edwards. Let's see media with some balls again, it has been far, far too long.

Oh man it is you again...  I have nothing against ActiveRecord, able programmers can make it work for attributed databases with complex relationships via views and syncs, also Ruby is great for making new websites but not necessarily integrating with older ones.  Please spare me the attacks you talk about Ruby fanboys?  Ruby on Rails is a fine beginner to intermediate platform much like ASP, PHP have been with a bit more architecture which is good in most cases. Remind me never to reply to you again as you get just as hate spewing as the ones against RoR. newlinechar  newlinechar Would your first choice for an attributed database be RoR? ActiveRecord is what RoR is based on, it is good for flatter database access, if you database is too normalized it becomes busy in api communication.

This is a surprise?  [Concurrency](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=threadring&amp;lang=all)  aside, I find it common to write Haskell code that is as fast as C.  It is true that for most things, the C can be tweaked to go a bit faster, but that tweaking needs to be done on a case-by-case basis.  In Haskell, it is easier to compose optimized components.  Better algorithms beat an optimized compiler any day and using the best algorithms everywhere in C code tends to be painful, error-prone, and usually disparaged as premature optimization.  However, once we find the hot-spots in C, improving the algorithm can involve significant refactoring. newlinechar  newlinechar To pick the first example from the article, the C code, built with gcc -O3 takes 1.8 seconds for my 40 MiB file.  The naive Haskell code takes 11 seconds with ghc -O2.  Not so good, but it is easy to use bytestrings: newlinechar  newlinechar     import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as C newlinechar     main = print . length . C.words =&lt;&lt; C.getContents newlinechar  newlinechar This takes 2.2 seconds.  Not bad, but length.words isn't fusing.  Until the compiler does this, we need to do a little extra work to beat C. newlinechar  newlinechar     import qualified Data.ByteString as S newlinechar     import Data.ByteString.Internal (isSpaceWord8) newlinechar  newlinechar     wcount :: S.ByteString -&gt; Int newlinechar     wcount s = wc 0 s newlinechar         where wc !n s | S.null s = n newlinechar                       | (isSpaceWord8 (S.head s)) = wc (n+1) (S.dropWhile isSpaceWord8 s') newlinechar                       | True = wc n s' newlinechar                   where s' = S.tail s newlinechar  newlinechar     main = print . wcount =&lt;&lt; S.getContents newlinechar  newlinechar And this runs in 0.68 seconds, more than twice as fast as the C code!

So are you asking why python doesn't ask you to be more like C or Pascal syntaxes where you have to say 'int i'? I'm not really sure, but would guess it has to do with less typing and the move by recent scripting languages to keep down the amount of boilerplate code you need to type. newlinechar  newlinechar It took me a while to adjust to when I first moved to python but you get used to it (mostly because I used to use declarations as a mechanism for understanding the composition of classes in java, but don't really think along those lines now). newlinechar  newlinechar I agree on you suggestion that you can mistype a variable in python as a result in some scenarios, but not as many as you might think. For example - you can't just randomly insert variables in python and have it work. newlinechar  newlinechar For example: a=a+1 wouldn't work if 'a' hadn't been previously defined. Equally, you couldn't say call_fn(a) if 'a' hadn't been defined. But you're right - you could mistype when setting a variable and accidentally create a second variable when you meant to rebind another. newlinechar  newlinechar     a = 5 newlinechar     print 'hello' newlinechar     as = 6 # whoops - I hit the 's' key accidentally. newlinechar  newlinechar I think I've only made this mistake once in the last year or so, and it was picked up quickly enough during debugging.

Because the mother is a concious person, alive and interacting with the world.

I think you've misjudged RP.  From everything I've heard him say he advocates a tempered, long-term dismantling of the _Federal_ government, but he's not even the hard core free marketer that everyone makes him out to be.  He continuously advocates building more veterans hospitals, supporting those who are dependent on government assistance, and States' rights.

Someday they may, at which point it is time to move on again. newlinechar * Because there are many legitimate uses for random &amp; random-looking data, is impossible to tell whether a package is legitimate or not. Both legitimate and evil packages can very well have perfectly functional (e.g. as a public key) random data in the same place. No amount of diligence can tell you that it was carefully chosen for an MD5 collision or not. newlinechar * Finally, you are requiring the vulnerable party to have near-oracular attention to detail, a level of detail that I certainly don't trust myself to have. There are enough hiding places in your average data format as to make finding it a Sisyphean task. Security is hard enough as it is, thanks. newlinechar * As a final note, respecting an end-of-file character isn't necessarily a bug; it's by design. That's why there is a special character denoted EOF.

Heh. newlinechar  newlinechar The point is that Ron Paul is in the Federal government, not his State's government. newlinechar  newlinechar All he's saying is that the federal government has no jurisdiction in these matters, which is correct. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, as far as State governments go, it is true that the goal of most libertarians is to strip *them* of these powers as well. And that shall be the next step in transforming the United States into a more libertarian nation. But as of right now, the States will have to decide if they want to be libertarian or authoritarian. We hope that they choose to be libertarian (and that is our goal), but this is out of the Federal government's hands.

Likewise the isspace caching--you probably realize that isspace() is almost certainly using its own compile-time-defined lookup table, so a compiler that allowed inlining of standard library functions would make your caching redundant. I know that these things _are_ useful with most C compilers, but that's ridiculous and somewhat sad, and it's partially the language's fault. Doing your own IO buffering can be called for when you're doing something fancy, but this case (linear reads) is something that shouldn't require any special work to run at maximum speed out of the box. What's nice about C is that you can do all these things yourself when you have to, but it shouldn't be necessary as often as it is.

He didn't have to be a pundit to pick apart Ron Paul. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying that he isn't right about a lot of things that don't work in today's political world. But Chomsky's modus is basically to explain and complain. In essence he IS a pundit. He provides political commentary without offering any solutions or better options. There is never anything constructive about his criticism.
As has already been pointed out to you in that original discussion, the things talked about in the 'We the People Act' relate specifically to issues of morality. It is the libertarian position that morality issues are to be decided at the local level, where the courts and the representatives of the people are more in touch with their community than people in Washington.

&gt;Ron Paul’s politics may be all but indistinguishable from Pat Buchanan’s, but his very demeanor, his feeble minded face, bleating voice and weak eyes make him seem non-threatening. Where David Duke or Pat Buchanan look the part of the wannabe Nazi, Ron Paul just looks like he needs a nap. Badly.
every single human being is evil.
&gt;...and Chomsky thinks a better candidate would be...? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm taking issue with your choice of word 'candidate.' The question of how to do things better is obviously an open debate, and chomsky has his opinions on that too (though not on this article). But it's not as though thoughtful historical analysis is without value. If you think that just throwing a Ron Paul or a Dennis Kucinich (or even a Ralph Nader) into the president's chair is going to fix everything then you're totally missing the point of his work. He does advocate a number of concrete ideas (universalism of morality, consensus building, opportunity implies responsibility, etc.), but just because he doesn't end it with a 'and that's why you should support XY next election!' doesn't make it 'not constructive.'

I think that this change makes sense. The country will now be four-and-a-half hours behind UTC, equivalent to mean solar time at a longitude of 67°30' W (15°·4.5=67°30'). The largest city in Venezuela, Caracas, is at 66°58' W, so most of the population will now be close to mean solar time. Before, it was at four hours behind UTC, corresponding to 60° W, a meridian that runs east of the country.

I just read the specification for the AMQP protocol.. pardon me but it seems a heck of a lot easier to follow than XMPP. newlinechar  newlinechar Going to xmpp.org and finding this didn't help with my confidence for XMPP: http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course the core RFCs are here: http://www.xmpp.org/rfcs/ newlinechar  newlinechar Isn't as functional for a message queuing operation as AMQP after the first XMPP Core RFC (3920)!

Maybe there are other industries that might share the same needs maybe not... but I find that whole claim a little too prophetic to be coming from someone who isn't involved in AMQP. newlinechar  newlinechar I did upvote the article as I think it raises general awareness of some useful technology standards that really ought to have a little more mind share. I will warn that I don't agree with the author very much on the same token. What does that mean for me? I'll probably use AMQP for message operations that fit it and XMPP for cases that might need the extra P or  any of its extensions. I'm also not against home-brewed protocols if used in the right contexts. newlinechar

Even 'random' data in the form of a public key can be verified: have them sign a message with the corresponding private key. In general, though, I agree that it is unreasonable for a sufficiently complex message for any signer to make any absolute guarantees about its legitimacy or safety, but that is what they purport to do. newlinechar  newlinechar It seems that according to the definition for a cryptographic algorithm given [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual/html_node/Digital-signatures.html), MD5 is indeed broken due to the collision resistance requirement. But only when the same source generates both &lt;x&gt; and &lt;x'&gt;, not in general. I'm not opposed to using stronger hashes than MD5, I just want people to understand what is possible and what isn't. newlinechar  newlinechar This collision resistance requirement comes about because the signer is allowed leniency in authenticating a message. They are not required to verify its efficiency, to ensure that the message is complete and that every part of it is integral, that nothing extra is added. Perhaps this is a practical concession in the real world, but it really seems like a cop-out to me. When reading the election prediction paper, you get to the point where they explain the message is in the form of a PDF with embedded data and it's immediately obvious that this would put the message's legitimacy in question. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, the weakness opened up in MD5 is that a single source may be able to produce multiple messages with the same hash. But the only valid use of this hash is to verify that the message you received matches the one your source intends to distribute. The fact that the same source can now generate multiple (likely somewhat questionable) messages with the same hash doesn't change this, although it gets a bit more complicated when intermediaries like the console companies are involved. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, respecting an EOF character and aborting when you're supposed to be signing the entire message is a bug, an implementation error, plain and simple.
The original poster is a little confused about the nature of open source. The only seriously useful thing a huge anonymous crowd can contribute to an open source project are well formed bug reports, and to a much smaller degree feature suggestions.

He goes so far as saying *everyone* can be a programmer if provided with an ideal environment; my instincts can't really accept that.

Good morning. My name is Steve Cobble. I’m a cofounder of Progressive Democrats of America and a cofounder of www.AfterDowningStreet.org  newlinechar  newlinechar Thirty-five years ago this week, I was elected a national convention delegate for George McGovern at the age of 20. Why was I for McGovern? Because he was the one working hardest to end the Vietnam War.  newlinechar  newlinechar Twenty years ago, I joined the Jesse Jackson for President Campaign as national delegate coordinator. It was a great campaign, the most incredible multi-racial, electoral insurgency this nation has ever seen. It changed the Democratic Party, and changed America. Why was I for Jackson? Because he was—and still is—the living bridge to Dr. King’s movement for peace and justice. newlinechar  newlinechar Five years ago, I joined up with Dennis Kucinich. Why? Because he had the character to lead the fight against the invasion of Iraq even when George W. Bush’s poll ratings were near 90%. When others were in hiding—at best—he risked his career to oppose an illegal, immoral war launched by a hugely popular, vindictive Administration.

I highly doubt anyone living near the US/Canada border lives in fear of monetary anarchy, not knowing what currency to accept.  Most businesses will accept both. newlinechar  newlinechar Currently there are numerous contract, legal tender, and tax laws which penalize the voluntary use of commodity money.  Removing those laws would allow, but not require, use of such money on an even playing field with Federal Reserve Notes.  If the market doesn't prefer them over FRNs, then no big deal, they won't get used. newlinechar  newlinechar Using different currencies isn't a big deal.
I remember when Marjoe Gortner blew the whistle on Billy Graham and those other tent preachers back in the early 70's. I believe his piece was in Rolling Stone, if I remember right.

But that's exactly the effect of buffering in this case when combined with inlining. The buffering ensures that you don't have to context switch into the OS too often (you obviously can't inline across that boundary in a traditional OS).
Absolutely.  I grew up in NYC and one of my high school english teachers spent an afternoon telling us how different the rest of the US was.  For one thing, she said kids who grow up in NYC tend to assume that the US population is roughly half black, but that outside of very large cities, the US was overwhelmingly white, and that most NYC kids had trouble believing it until they saw it.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar She was right; none of us exactly thought she was lying, but we were all baffled by the possibility that the racial makeup of the rest of the country could be so different from what we'd grown up seeing.  And when I did go to live in a smaller midwestern town, the culture shock was far more overwhelming than the racial differences (which were already disorienting enough).  I would have expected differences of that magnitude if I was visiting South America or Europe, but I wasn't anticipating that 'mainstream america' was going to be so different from everything I'd grown up around in NYC. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Network TV made a lot more sense to me after that, though.  Not to say it seemed any better, but it didn't seem so completely different from any real humans I'd seen--it made sense in the context of what I'd seen of small-town and suburban american culture.

It is distinctly evident, wjw75, that you don't know these people.  'Special interest' libertarians are common enough, who won't give but will happily take from you -- the bastards who gave us modern 'free trade', in which everyone is free to sell us what we tell them to sell us at the price we name. newlinechar  newlinechar For my part, I want to leave other people alone.  I'll bear as much burden as I know how, but I look at this country around me (and this world around it) and I can't help but wonder what really caused the problems I see. newlinechar  newlinechar How many of our problems are caused by our foreign policy?  By our fear-mongering, here and worldwide?  By our installation of despots?  Let's trade broadly, but let's not be in the trade of establishing dictators: and let's ship our billions and trillions overseas as goods, not bombs. newlinechar  newlinechar How many of our problems are caused by locking up harmless men and women?  By destroying families, by tearing apart communities?  By establishing gender imbalances in society so women in the victimized subgroups have to take the men they can get, or be alone -- giving priggish, infantile men the chance to abuse and objectify them, to use them and never have to grow up?  Let's get back to liberty, stop locking so many people up, and end the drug war. newlinechar  newlinechar Government can work, but it can't work on the basis we have right now.

But there are many factors that could have caused that to happen. newlinechar  newlinechar One of the trickiest things about shareware is finding a balance for incentive to pay. If your app feels 'disabled' until registered, people will often simply give up on it. But if your users don't gain anything by paying you, most simply won't. A related issue is figuring out how much to charge. newlinechar  newlinechar Examples of failed business plans can be found for any sales model in any industry, but it doesn't follow that those models or industries are necessarily unprofitable. newlinechar  newlinechar I am a Mac developer, and I know that on that platform there are a number of successful shareware companies, like [Panic](http://panic.com/) and [Delicious Monster](http://www.delicious-monster.com/) off the top of my head. According to wikipedia Delicious Monster's shareware program [Delicious Library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_Library) made about $250,000 in the first month after its release. I don't know how many downloads they've had, but the total number of users of Mac OS X is estimated around 20 million, so Delicious Library has clearly had fewer downloads than the FTP program you mentioned. newlinechar  newlinechar It is possible that shareware is a more viable model on the Mac than it is on other platforms, but somehow I doubt it. I think it's more a matter of figuring out the economics of the situation so that users have enough reason to compensate you for your work.

You're dead right. I work all day in a slightly odd offshoot of Java, where it's embedded - and here the whole primitives/objects debate takes exactly the opposite line to that Web-heads take. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason Java is confusing, and the reason it's brilliant at the same time, is it works in both domains.

I literally do write Java 1.4, since generics and auto-boxing have been such a mess (and the embedded systems don't like them either!) newlinechar  newlinechar Java is a great idea, but they need to rethink and reimplement it from the ground up, or at least have the balls to throw massive parts of it away.

*if*. ACL only supports class sealing in some restricted cases. SBCL does so a bit. But, even then, if you don't have generic function sealing too, it's far from being as efficient as struct accessors. Even if you can very efficiently get to the right slot, you can't inline the right method body directly. Moreover, due to change-class (not class redefinition), you usually have to go through an additional level of indirection than structs.

A wikipedia search for 'sociopath' redirects to 'psychopathy.'  There appear to be minor differences: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;David T. Lykken proposes that psychopathy and sociopathy are two distinct kinds of antisocial personality. He holds that psychopaths are born with temperamental differences such as impulsivity, cortical underarousal, and fearlessness that lead them to risk-seeking behavior and an inability to internalize social norms; sociopaths, on the other hand, have relatively normal temperaments; their personality disorder being more an effect of negative sociological factors like parental neglect, delinquent peers, poverty, and extremely low or extremely high intelligence.

This is what was reported in the Catholic press: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Given the publicity about priests who have abused young males, it is understandable that some may be led to assume that a homosexual orientation is more likely to be associated with sexual abuse of a child. But this is an assumption that needs to be challenged. Pedophilia is distinguished by the fact that a person is attracted to a child as an object of sexual desire. It is the age of the child, not the child’s gender, that specifies the disorder. Often pedophiles will abuse children of both genders. Thus, sexual orientation as commonly understood is secondary to the dominance of a disordered attraction to prepubescent children. Pedophiles who are attracted to boys and those who are attracted to girls have more in common with each other than they do with homosexuals and heterosexuals generally. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;A somewhat different pattern is evident when the child is an adolescent and postpubescent. An adult’s sexual attraction to an adolescent, referred to as ephebophilia, shows a more decided preference for one gender over the other and, in this limited sense, parallels sexual orientation.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar https://americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=1673

That's one of the reasons that all your anecdotal evidence is just not that helpful. While it's undoubtedly true that some perpetrators abuse girls more than boys or vice versa *especially when the children are older*, it's by no means a truism. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In many families, the dynamic is such that only the girls end up coming forward or legal action is pursued only for cases involving girls. There is by no means a 1 to 1 relationship between victim and prosecution.

Seems you are unaware that sperm donation is anonymous, and the donor has NO CONTACT with or indeed knowledge of specifically who they may fertilize.  The responsibility is transferred absolutely.  This is the way the arrangement is defined and licensed by the state, it seems, for good reason, making it utterly different from the sorry example in the news story, where all 3 adults are grossly at fault. newlinechar  newlinechar In the original example, the child's rights are not protected.  That's why I describe it as being bargained away so the parents can go after what they personally want without placing the interests of the child first.  The donation laws are, I imagine, designed to protect that interest. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, a verbal contract isn't worth the paper it's printed on.   newlinechar  newlinechar

The drug trade currently represents the best economic opportunity for many young, black youth, even adjusting for the risk of death, injury, or imprisonment (See Freakonomics).   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It produces gains for some, mostly those at the top of the pyramid, but has tremendous negative external costs on communities.  It is no surprise that communities where the drug trade is heavy, there are severe a lack of other economic opportunities, like local businesses. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This perpetuates the cycles - drug crime chases out legitimate businesses, which leaves the drug trade as the most viable option for many.  Eliminate the violence and you make way for legitimate economic opportunities.

Actually, Shareware is much more profitable on a mac.

Hence 'pre-sexual'. Yes. Wherein sexual identity is defined by the gender of those you are attracted to, this must be defined by the sexual characteristics which appeal to you. The vast majority of male pedophiles are heterosexual, even when discussing pedophiles whom prefer young boys. newlinechar  newlinechar This is not them simply being in denial; this is in terms of physiological responses. The sexual attraction to children is a paraphilia, not a sexual orientation.

You make a good argument, but I still prefer to use the correct term if there is any doubt that it is archaic. I also want to clarify: I don't usually call out other people for misusing 'who', so I'm a little shocked that everybody jumped down this guy's throat for using 'whom'. I don't really care if it dies out on its own, but as of right now it's still proper grammar. Nobody should be insulted for speaking correctly.
I kid you not sir. This happened late '05, no parental permission was ever given, except the paper all parents sign in the beginning of the year basically giving the school permission to do anything they want. I was in one of the classes escorted down to the area in the gym, we had to keep quiet and walk with our hands on our head, when I refused to keep my hands up they threated me, and I am ashamed to admit that after four guys with M4s told me to do it I listened. A couple other students were less compliant and were arrested. Along with a few other kids who were unlucky enough to have a little weed on them when they brought the dogs in. All this was dubbed a 'lockdown drill' for our protection.

While he has stated he is personally against abortion he thinks the federal government should have no say in the matter.  It's too personal it should be decided at the local level, he is for this, not a flat out decision to ban abortion.

&gt;You seem to believe that a large increase in the number of armed citizens would reduce crime and robberies. newlinechar  newlinechar Incorrect. I believe that the possibility of more armed civilians will be enough, and simply because everyone would be able to buy them doesn't mean that everyone would. Like yourself, there are many people who would not feel comfortable owning a gun. But importantly, that is not the only issue at hand.  newlinechar  newlinechar I will not pretend that 2nd amendment rights are panacea for violence. Education is key, amongst many other issues. There is no silver bullet to ending violence, especially in communities such as the ones described in this article. The right to bear arms is meaningless in a locality where the rule of law is flagrantly disregarded. Neither your favored situation nor mine would work here because nearly everyone already has a gun, and those who seek to disavow them are targeted for that very decision. The only solution I see in this situation is an uprising from within. A firm resolution from the members of the community to reverse their lot. Without that, our discussion is meaningless. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Only criminals would be armed. Sounds good to me. newlinechar  newlinechar And that is horrifying to me.

Merely 10 would be a luxury. One doctor's surgery I used to visit in North London routinely had more than 60 people waiting for appointments with three doctors first thing in the morning, almost all of them Turkish immigrants apparently straight off the plane. Another in West London would commonly have 30 to 40 people waiting to see two doctors. By the time you got to see the doctor yourself they were usually so harrased and overworked they could barely give you 3 minutes before hustling you out the door, maybe with a referral to a clinic sometime in the coming six months.

Xbox Live from Microsoft makes sure that every game developed for their service is vetted through their 'portfolio management' group of nazis.  Sony has similar plans for PSN and exorbitant prices to even start developing for their platform.  Nintendo just ignores anyone who isn't Japanese.  Steam on the PC side takes massive chunks of revenue and has a high bar of entry as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The companies that currently provide, or are providing in the next few years, an online distribution infrastructure that could enable such a market if they would simply ALLOW it, are crippling their services.  They know this is going to cost them money.  They have seen YouTube.  They have seen all of the online ventures that only benefit from openness, and yet they still close off their systems.  Also, if you talk to anyone involved in the game development business you quickly learn that it is a very insular and hierarchical group with elevated aristocrats lording over a sea of peons expected to work 100 hour weeks for months on end to crank out another movie licensed megabudget hunk of turd for an uberpublisher.  For small game companies the goal is to be cannibalized by one of the uberpublishers.  No one can really speak up because it is so easy to get 'black balled' if you don't 'play the game'.  And don't get me started on how far the dying retail market will go to put the stop to any of these online distribution models.

The legislation he has sponsored is directly in line with what the Constitution says.

Ron Paul makes it clear in his position that he understands that the government has promised people social security, and he understands that the government has 'trained' people to be co-dependent on the system and so he won't just cut it off immediately, but instead phase it out and make sure people have lots of options to opt out.  Also, what he will do is get rid of the social security taxes which he and everyone else understands is a fraud anyhow.

This would almost certainly make life worse for these employees and make sure that such conditions get reported less rather than more frequently. But, hey, at least we'd feel all warm and fuzzy.

Paul advocates reducing the size and scope of the government not because it's full of incompetent power brokers whose allegiances are to themselves and their corporate sponsors rather than the American people, but rather, he advocates it because: newlinechar  newlinechar A) It's inherently oppressive to force the people to pay for government programs and, being a 'necessary evil,' should be minimized as much as humanly possible. newlinechar  newlinechar B) He believes the for-profit marketplace can provide most goods and services cheaper and better than the not-for-profit government can, and at least empirically it's tough to argue against that.

There are definitely some nice aspects to a good job as compared to your own business. For example, on average, the stress and hours are a lot less if you're not running your own business. This makes it a lot nicer for sustaining relationships and/or having a family. There's also usually less risk. newlinechar  newlinechar The flipside is that you still have to report to someone else (which isn't so bad if you work somewhere where you actually like the people), and you generally don't have the chance of striking it rich that you would with your own business.
I support CFLs, but I am against a law like this. I still use incandescent bulbs in a few places where I require high color reproduction quality.

&gt;Hong kong is a tiny tax haven. It only benefits from its low regulatory system because everywhere else is more regulated so it attracts greedy companies wanting to pay less tax. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If everywhere else had its regulations, itd be screwed and so would everywhere else.

One can conclude that pedophilia is *often* a separate preference from hetero- or homo-sexuality, but one cannot conclude that 'most male pedophiles -- even those whom prefer boys -- are heterosexual.'   newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, one study (Erickson, 1988) claims that 'Eighty-six percent of offenders against males described themselves as homosexual or bisexual,' but this study is dismissed by the  author of the page because it fails to differentiate between gay and bisexual offenders.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another study (Marshall et al. 1988) found that 14 of 21 offenders against male children were more aroused by female adults and 7 were more aroused by males.  So on the one hand, from this tiny sample you are correct that most male pedophiles that prefer boys are hetero; on the other hand, gays are over-represented at 1/3 of the sample relative to their 1/20 share of the population.

Yes, what benjamincanfly said.  Greenpeace foster a rather aggressive approach to conservation, which I sort of find repulsive.  They often put human lives at risk, not just those of their willing members, to make a point.  The point they make is often sullied by their methods and they end up alienating normally sympathetic people like myself. newlinechar  newlinechar The more you read about Greenpeace the more you will find it is a political movement more than it is a conservation movement.  Even the founder has abandoned and condemned the charity for reasons he explains in an episode of Penn and Teller's 'Bullshit'. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't give to Greenpeace because they just don't seem to be responsible or level headed.

Money opens up tons of educational and research opportunities. It's not as though it's going to some giant pot somewhere to ferment. And even then, the endowment acts as a great source for university development.  newlinechar  newlinechar In my three and a half years at my college so far, we've added a new library, renovated the old one, added a new dorm, giant art museum, added an Islamic Studies Center, built among the largest interdisciplinary research buildings in the world, doubled the size of the public policy school, created a giant new student plaza, and even built one of the first bleeding-edge, high-tech sustainable homes for students, designed by kids in the engineering school. And that's since 2004, and my school's endowment isn't as big as the top Ivy's. And, our football program sucks epically.

The trust fund covers a tiny percentage of the total current obligation, and as you suggest politicians left and right have been happy to go ahead and spend it on other things.  So I basically don't consider these savings in my analysis. newlinechar  newlinechar The fundamental problem as I see it is that social security has very little to do with savings, and a whole lot to do with redistribution, from the current working to the current retired.  As such, more retirees per worker, for the reasons described above, mean more burden for current workers. newlinechar  newlinechar Alternatively, savings-based approaches always maintain parity between the working and the retired, because they are the same person at different times, and the amount saved need be much less due to expected growth of in the market from technological advances and such. newlinechar  newlinechar If you're concerned about inequity, there's room here for subsidizing the poor's retirement accounts, which would require a much smaller role in the economy to achieve the same effects. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm guessing the only reason the more sound approach wasn't taken was that it didn't provide the political benefits to Roosevelt, as it would have been decades before people would need to start drawing out funds.

Lower income people must spend a higher percentage of their income for basic necessities. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the highest taxing percentages on wages are reserved for the wealthiest.  There is essentially a purely flat tax on capital gains, but that flat rate is below the rate on most wages.  Thus, the wealthiest pay low income taxes because much of their income is from capital gains, not from wages.   newlinechar  newlinechar The problem is that if you raise capital gains tax, you reduce the benefit for people to invest in businesses that provide the goods and services we all use. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a catch-22, and if anyone tells you there's a simple solution, they're full of crap.

Thanks for the kind comment! Well, I'm not too sure about the price. Pricing is so much harder than coding that it's sick. newlinechar  newlinechar I described the pricing history in the comment above. I've always received about the same number of complaints about the price (few), and sales have grown more or less steadily. Many sales are from companies too. newlinechar  newlinechar Even if I'm totally positive that programmers don't like buying software tools, I nowadays tend to think that I'd be doing better at $99. I think we programmers err on the side of selling too cheap more often than  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also quite liberal with sending out discounts. Part of the thinking is that if the actual, real, only problem is the price, the person will at least drop me a line (some people do). Interested fellow redditors, feel free to drop me a line and I'll give you a nice discount. newlinechar  newlinechar Except for the support issues (which are a big burden for a one-man-band), I'd love to sell 4x as much at $29 - but I think it just wouldn't happen. I think most of the price sensitivity comes in the gap from $0 to $10, the jump from $10 to $79 only accounts for a few extra lost users.

A `Seq` of `Choice` of empty-accepting expressions will make it go exponential, iterating over tons of equal expressions for each letter. That issue would probably become obvious when one would do the obvious thing and prune `Phi` continuations (states) away from the choices. Merging equivalent states is only slightly more complex than pruning `Phi`s. For example, one could do hash-consing and use a hash table of states that already are in the toplevel `Choice` (or transitively so) expression.

To be honest, I am not really sure if 'mentally unfit' is counted in that number. The question is, should it? You are right, you are an objector and should be counted as one.

The problem these days in Western nations, is the trend that governments wish to put people in prison **before** they commit crimes. The ethic in previous decades was that people had to commit a crime, before they would go to prison. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The oligarchy of the soviet union was a government which we on the other side of the globe deplored for several reasons - but one reason, was this same authoritarian practice.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar When a person is imprisoned because of supposed inclinations she or he has... it's the death knells for a free society. The thing is, that governing officials get big heads about how much influence they really have on their society. They think that the police keep order in a society; where in fact, the police are very small part of a very complex social process whereby order is kept in a society. Those who ignore the real ways in which our society maintains peace among neighbors, will act in ways which undermine this process. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This woman's imprisonment is an example of government *undermining* the process whereby peace is kept in the streets of our towns and cities. Does that sound backwards?  Let me explain. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Well, how do towns and cities keep the peace? The police have never been able to be everywhere, or see everything. That's absurd. What happens is that people who see a crime happening, can use their best judgement as to what is best for the situation. If they think that it's best to talk to the person or ignore it altogether, they can do that. If they believe it's best to notify someone in authority in the situation - a boss, or professor, or manager... they can do that. If they want to go directly to the police, they can do that, as well. But the locus of control, is in society's own hands. We, as citizens, are the ones who choose to hold ourselves and others to social standards. And laws are *our* tool with which to do that. Authoritarians in positions of government should not think to usurp that role, just because of a change in society with the internet - where ideas and information are so freely shared and passed around. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now for our current system to work properly, we have to be more friendly. They need to engage their neighbors in conversation on the train, and bus, and on the sidewalk. People in the cities of the usa think it is respectful to ignore their neighbors. That's just cold. That's not respect. If people want to live in unique ways - go out and get a house somewhere out in the rural countryside; it's cheap. If you're in the city, you have to appreciate diversity - but you also have to talk to one another - and be a community. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Thankfully, we have libertarianism rising as an influence in our society. This is a good trend... where people have realized that they don't need authoritarians around. newlinechar  newlinechar

Having help with basic survival means that he can focus attention on education (or other means of escape from poverty) more than if he were having to focus on his attention on his basic survival. Therefore, help with basic survival is also help in escaping the situation.
It's unfortunate that a pejorative Seinfeld comparison was the only sense you were able to make out of this video, or at least the only insight you felt strongly enough about to share, and moreso that your comment is the highest rated one on this submission. newlinechar  newlinechar For what it's worth, I didn't read him as being defensive or upset - perhaps surprised and a little abrupt; maybe not unwarranted when a student halfway (literally) into your college course reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of two fundamental binding constructs (his problem was really with DEFINE and LET), basically indicating that none of the examples from the previous modules would have made any kind of sense to him.

Look at it this way.  The Boy Scouts get public money often in the form of discounts at state parks, etc.  This means that they are publicly funded.  This means that they cannot legally discriminate against gays. newlinechar  newlinechar If the Boy Scouts allowed gays to join, but then had a camp that the gay kids could not go to, should the Boy Scouts be able to say, 'No, no... it's okay see, cause this one camp doesn't use public money, unlike the rest of our organization'? newlinechar  newlinechar The answer, of course, is no.  The Boy Scouts as a whole are publicly funded, therefore everything they do should be subject to the same rules. newlinechar  newlinechar To take it back to the university... yes, you can say that so-and-so amount of money was used for this or that.  But the univeristy as a whole is still publicly funded and should be treated as such. newlinechar  newlinechar Any public university football program is publicly funded, no matter how much or little they say their tax dollars go directly towards it.

Yeah, I switched from Science to Engineering in graduate school for the same reason.

Somewhere around 1-1.6 bits a letter; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_entropy and http://math.ucsd.edu/~crypto/java/ENTROPY/ newlinechar  newlinechar Now, obviously how many bits per seconds that translates to is hard to gauge because of speed, but from rapper speed records like http://sparkplugged.net/2007/10/outsider-speed-rap-extraordinaire/ I think ~800 syllables (at about 1 or 2 letters on average?) is near the peak, which would be (800 * 2 * 1.6) / 60 bits a second, or ~43 bits a second (assuming one raps that fast, is understood perfectly, each syllable is very short, etc).

How do you define 'big'?  Ada is a general-purpose fully object-oriented programming language, ala C++ or Java.  A few years ago I read comparisons of Ada with other language in terms of keyword count and other naive measures of programming language complexity, but can't seem to locate any of them now.  Ada always came off favorably in these measures, which were undertaken mostly to counter the popular misconception that Ada was a complicated, unwieldy language. newlinechar  newlinechar You're free to review the [specs](http://www.adaic.org/standards/index.html) themselves and draw your own conclusions. After the initial release of 'object-based' Ada 83 there came the fully object-oriented Ada 95 and now the recently approved Ada 2005 standard. newlinechar  newlinechar Informally speaking, as one well-versed in the language, the specs and the language itself are well-designed, consistently defined, and with very few 'gotchas' that programmers have to be mindful of.

The 'semi-barbaric King' of an ancient land utilized an unusual form of administering justice for offenders in his kingdom. The offender would be placed in an arena where his only way out would be to go through one of two doors. Behind one door was a beautiful woman hand-picked by the king and behind the other was a ravenous tiger. The offender was then asked to pick one of the doors. If he picked the door with the woman behind it, then he was declared innocent and as a reward he was required to marry the woman, regardless of previous marital status. If he picked the door with the tiger behind it, though, then he was deemed guilty and the tiger would rip him to pieces. newlinechar  newlinechar One day the king found that his daughter, the princess, had taken a lover far beneath her station. The king could not allow this and so he threw the suitor in prison and set a date for his trial in the arena. On the day of his trial the suitor looked to the princess for some indication of which door to pick. The princess, did, in fact, know which door concealed the woman and which one the tiger, but was faced with a conundrum. If she indicated the door with the tiger, then the man she loved would be killed on the spot; however, if she indicated the door with the lady, her lover would be forced to marry another woman and even though he would be alive she would never be with him again. Finally she does indicate a door, which the suitor then opens. newlinechar  newlinechar Did the tiger come out of that door, or did the lady?

&gt; Unit-testing is generally a necessity now, and I've never seen a bug caught by Java's type system that wouldn't be caught by comprehensive unit tests. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The key word being _comprehensive_. I have yet to see 100% coverage in the real world, although I'm sure it exists. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The second prong of the argument is that turnaround is important. The compiler is faster at catching problems with types than a suite of unit-tests are. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Not that Java is particularly hot at either. It doesn't allow you to change code during execution, and the type system is anemic.
you're mistaken with biodiesel - the implications for conservation when land is devoted to *growing fuel* will cause untold hunger as land that should be used to feed hungry poor people is instead co-opted to keep fat rich fuckers on the road in their unbelievably inefficient SUVs. The big problem with biodiesel is that it allows the same infrastructure of liquid fuel, which is highly attractive to the liquid fuel purveyors currently selling fossil fuels. It's a distraction from a move to purely electric cars, which would cut the current liquid fuel companies completely out of the loop. biodiesel is less green than petrol burning in a modern clean engine, as there is still a huge energy overhead fertilising, growing, moving it all and refining the fuel, as opposed to just pumping it out of the ground. The return on energy investment is way too small. newlinechar  newlinechar Biodiesel's only possible hope is biodiesel from algae, which is hundreds of times more efficient per square km than any land based source, but still, electrics with maybe extra power units (such as a biodiesl generator) that could be plugged in specifically for long journeys would be my proposed solution, when I get round to saving the world....

How much do you want to bet that that woman who wrote harry potter is universally more well known that old Arthur C., though he is a better, more respected author?

&gt;Ada always came off favorably in these measures, which were undertaken mostly to counter the popular misconception that Ada was a complicated, unwieldy language. newlinechar  newlinechar That's the impression I was under. I think this is due to the formality of the spec. I'm looking at it now and it says, newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The process by which a construct achieves its run-time effect is called *execution*. This process is also called *elaboration* for declarations and  *evaluation* for expressions. One of the terms execution, elaboration, or evaluation is defined by this International Standard for each construct that has a run-time effect.' newlinechar  newlinechar Sounds too formal for typical programmers I think. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Informally speaking, as one well-versed in the language, the specs and the language itself are well-designed, consistently defined, and with very few 'gotchas' that programmers have to be mindful of. newlinechar  newlinechar Excellent, I may have to take a look at Ada...any recommendations for compilers?

Okay, we are talking about different things here.  Yes they may profit on football and it pays for the other sports.  But what I'm saying is they should get rid of all the sports entirely, as they do lose money on sports overall.   newlinechar  newlinechar Students are paying for an education, if they want to play or watch sports that should be a private, separate enterprise.

Efficient automatic promotion is simple: just put the fixnum fastpath inline and conditionally jump to the bignum functions on overflow/bignum inputs. SBCL (most compiled implementations of languages with implicit promotion, actually) does that efficiently, especially when the inputs are known to be fixnums. Again, since you get direct access to the flags, it's much easier to deal with overflows in the implementation. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As for annotations, I don't like magic that much, so I didn't think of a coercing static type system.
Libertarian economic policy will lead to the destruction of the middle class?  Take a good look around!  The middle class is already well on its way to destruction, and there's every indication that this destruction is a result of over-reaching social programs, unchecked government spending, and a corporate-government compact led by lobbyists that has helped degrade the free market as badly as a socialist agenda ever would. newlinechar  newlinechar MORE government intervention is rarely a solution to broad economic problems long term.  For every example you give me where you think it's worked, I can give you 10 that has failed miserably.  Number one would be the United States.  The greatest economic nation on earth for years and years is being crippled by it's own government because it is becoming ever more bloated and corrupt.

This depends on the size of the country. newlinechar For example, in holland, which is very small, most will speak english good enough to explain say, an abstract math problem.  newlinechar  newlinechar The reason is size.

Which means we always hear English, then read the Dutch. newlinechar  newlinechar Off course, by the age of 14 you no longer read the subtitles.  newlinechar  newlinechar And i'm not even touching Internet and Music here.  newlinechar  newlinechar The point is we consume more content, than we could possible produce in our own native language.

I was hoping someone had made this point already. If a kid grows up in a state where the university has a great football team year after year, he will grow up a fan of the team and be much more likely to go there rather than out of state.   newlinechar  newlinechar I go the University of Minnesota and we have terrible sports teams.  Although it's a great university, only 25% of students come from outside Minnesota and bordering states.  Good sports teams=more national publicity.
I grew up with food allergies and I think this is borderline paranoid on the part of these kids and their parents. Part of having a 'disability' is learning to get along in the real world.

It is a measure of all new projects coming online in the next few years by using their peak oil output. Only actual projects with actual pipes and people working on them are counted. It basically says that at a maximum, we could see 2 million barrels per day added from these projects in 2008 and 2009. If depletion is running at 2.5% globally, these new additions will mean that oil production will remain flat. If depletion has not set in (i.e. we are still pre-Peak Oil), then we could see up to 78mb/d out of the oil system. That would mean lower prices for the next few years. newlinechar  newlinechar So it is both a blessing and a curse. We probably won't have a real peak in the next few years, but that could make people think that we don't have serious structural problems with oil supplies. By 2010, the output from these projects will return to 2007 levels and remain there for at least 4 years. Depletion is very likely to show it's ugly head at that point. newlinechar  newlinechar Hope this helps.

But as long as there's [those 1,138 legal benefits, rights, and privileges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_and_responsibilities_of_marriages_in_the_United_States) that come with marital status, it's a civil rights issue. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd favor eliminating those 1,138 benefits or otherwise separating them from the religious institution of marriage. But in either case, as long as those benefits exist, they're constitutionally obligated to dole them out in a gender-neutral way. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It essentially gives 'special rights' to a segment of the population. newlinechar  newlinechar Equal rights != special rights. To my knowledge, gay couples are not asking for any rights above and beyond those that straight couples currently enjoy. What's special about them? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If they were indeed civil rights, then the constitution would already protect them. newlinechar  newlinechar 14th amendment, equal protection under the law. This is a rather straightforward application of it; see my reply to HukdUnFonx for an elaboration on that point. newlinechar  newlinechar The liberties are already guaranteed to you, they're just being denied.

Well the article in question refers to outlawing an opinion, which would be a violation of the First Amendment.  Hate crimes, at least in the American sense, are not at issue in this article. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But I will have to say that I don't understand why conservatives are against hate crime legislation.  After all, don't conservatives want criminals to spend more time in prison?  Therefore, any law that gives more time to people who commit assault should be a positive. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That motive is taken into account should not be a reason to discount hate crime legislation.  After all, motive is a factor in whether a crime is committed.  If someone deposits $9,999 into a bank it is a crime, but only if their motive is to avoid the automatic notice to the IRS if 10 G is deposited. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Even murder charges are based heavily on motive.  If someone kills their spouse to collect insurance money, that is 1st degree; if they kill them because they just found them in bed with someone else, that is 2nd degree or manslaughter; if they kill in self defense, that is not murder at all. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Logically, society has chosen to give harsher sentences for crimes that are more heinous.  If an assualt occurs because the victim is of a different race I think that is can fairly be seen as a more heinous assualt than an assault that was the result of a verbal argument, for instance.
That's what I worry about though. If they keep the function aliases in the global namespace, that keeps the crappy functions in usage that much longer, and makes the transition that much more difficult and confusing.

&gt; In the past, image formats were implemented in all browsers on the basis of what was popular. This was almost a financial disaster with GIF, if anyone remembers. newlinechar  newlinechar GIF wasn't created until two years after HTML 2 specification was written.  If HTML 2 had got involved with image formats, then it would have probably been something like XBM selected, which seems ludicrously outdated these days.  When HTML 5 gets widely deployed, it's probable that the same thing will be said about Theora, if not at first, then certainly later. newlinechar  newlinechar The worse situation, of course, would have been if GIF had become popular before the HTML 2 specification was written.  If you recall, virtually nobody was aware of the patent problems with GIF until long after it became ubiquitous.  If an HTML specification had selected an image format in the late 90s, it would have been the patent-encumbered GIF. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: For the people modding me down, please read past the first paragraph.  The fact that I was off on the timeline doesn't mean my comment is without merit, in fact it makes it all the more pertinent.  If HTML 2 took the same approach with `&lt;img&gt;` as HTML 5 is doing with `&lt;video&gt;`, then the specification would have recommended GIF, which we now know to be patent-encumbered. newlinechar

Ok. Going to try to explain this one more time and then give up. Monads are not fundamentally about sequencing (even though they can be used for this -- `seq` can too, for example), and certainly not fundamentally about IO. In fact IO is sort of a 'magic' monad in that it nearly *uniquely* doesn't export its constructor. unsafePerformIO, while it has to do with IO, also has nothing to do with sequencing, and doesn't solve any issues with laziness and indeterminate order of execution.  Hence, from the documentation: 'This is the 'back door' into the IO monad, allowing IO computation to be performed at any time. For this to be safe, the IO computation should be free of side effects and independent of its environment.' In other words, if you use unsafePerformIO to add monadic effects (as distinct from Monads) to code later on, you are being a bad programmer and inviting disaster.

Except that you have to add a sizeable contrivance to your lexical analyser to account for the lack of braces (basically, the lexer adds them after mangling tabs to be spaces and maintaining a stack with the current indentation level. I've always believed that if you need to explicitly create a stack in a lexer then you are doing it wrong). newlinechar  newlinechar It's the same argument as not explicitly ending lines. Once you've done that you need to add messy continuations for statements that span multiple lines. newlinechar  newlinechar All of this can be done but it adds unnecessary overhead.

I realize NULL completely borks relational algebra, but suppose you have an organization that tracks demographic data about people, but often doesn't have complete information. You might have race, religion, marital status, height, weight, and 10 other fields. To be strictly correct from a relational algebra standpoint, since you may or may not have these fields, they should each be contained in their own table. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, there might be a table for race that contained the field(s) to foreign key into person and a field for race that keyed into a lookup table of selectable races. A table like this would potentially be present for each of 20 nullable fields. newlinechar  newlinechar This would be a completely correct implementation from a relational algebra standpoint, and a coding and administrative nightmare from a practical standpoint. Having fields in the person table, by contrast, mucks up the relational algebra, but makes for a database structure that is usable in the real world.

Ah, I misunderstood the original comment and thought he meant that it's obsolete. I agree with what you said, but I have seen postgres do very very well with my data when I was handling rather large volumes of it (about 6m of logs) and I needed operations performed on a few millions of rows interactively. Postgres was great, giving me results in tenths or hundredths of a second.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I also like SQLite a lot for small stuff, but I wouldn't use it for any large-scale data crunching. I actually don't think I'll use MySQL again, not that there's anything terribly wrong with it, I was just very very pleased with what I saw with postgres, both with speed/full-featuredness and the helpful people at #postgres.

Because only one longshot Republican is less insane than any of the Democrats, and three of the Democrats are significantly more sane than him, with the rest about on par? newlinechar  newlinechar Since the only good Republican has about a one in a million chance of winning the nomination (believe it or not, the Internet is not an accurate sample by any means), it would be to everyone's advantage if whoever does get nominated among them has as little chance of winning as possible.

I agree here. The official explanation has been put forth. It's up the truth movement to provide hard scientific evidence to disprove the official theory and I have not heard anything like that.

My opinion is that yes it is possible and yes you are supposed to believe the official explanation until you can scientifically or legally prove something else otherwise, count me amongst the sheep.
People are leaping into action.  But it's not like it's going to make the TV news most of the time.  A lot of the 'leaping' is really boring, time-consuming work, hardly suitable for a 20-second news spot.

Even a public protest of anything less than 100,000 people is considered not-newsworthy, let alone all the other forms of activism going on constantly. newlinechar

Gore's true colors come out, (again).  I understand that it would suck to be #2, then legitimately win (and lose) the #1 job, and then have to even contemplate some #3,4 or 5 position.

If Gore actually had much sincerity about forwarding environmental progress, then he wouldn't be so quick to reject any notion of serving as Environmental Czar; a position he'd probably be good at.

I really don't think anyone who is honest with themselves could really believe in magical powers, miracles, or any other contradictions to the laws of physics.

Yes Africa is the source of the human species which is one of the reasons why race is more a social construct. However, that was almost ten thousand years ago (I do not profess to have the accurate numbers here) and the different races sort of developed as a result of migration, and the qualities that were ripe for  reproduction were resultant of changes in the environment (for example, the heat in Africa required more melanin, not so in the much colder Northern Europe). newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: fact-checking

I can't comment very much on media representation, since I don't watch much TV or listen to the radio, but I'd say there has been plenty of focus on Hispanics long before all this recent hubbub about the border.  I admit I may be biased because I live in an area with somewhere around 50% Hispanic population, while during the entire time I was in high school there were only 2 black students (a brother and sister, one a year younger than me and one 2 years older).  But of what media I do see, I certainly haven't noticed any particular lack of Hispanic characters.  I might agree on Asians if you mean Asians acting as stereotypes, but acting as typical Americans who happen to be of Asian descent, I haven't noticed an under representation there, either.  I guess there aren't very many popular rock stars that are Asian, but I suspect that has little or nothing to do with racism.

However, there are no known codecs that satisfy all the current players: we need a codec that is known to not require per-unit or per-distributor licensing, that is compatible with the open source development model, that is of sufficient quality as to be usable, and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large companies.

I live in a country that is building new nuclear powerstations, as they are the most viable carbon free energy source. And we do get a lot of idiot protestors, who in media are painfully obvious that they have no idea what they are protesting around. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Our country is very active in biodiesel research and especially on using several different raw matrerials.

It was unfounded, but what is worse that before the greenpeace campaign they asked the forestry industry for donations.  newlinechar  newlinechar As the forestry companies did not want to 'donate' for the cause they were taken as target.  newlinechar  newlinechar And in the campaign in Germany they had magnificent trunk of great old tree that they claimed was harvested from Finnish forest. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, too bad that there was police report on theft of that tree. So press found out that it had been felled by storm in the roadside, and was stolen by greenpeace before the land owner could collect it for logging.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;RE: Biodeisel... take a look at what's happening in Indonesia.

I hope you are not interpreting Ron Paul's actions in this matter to be a description of his actions or history in general. newlinechar  newlinechar In your statement: 'I agree with Paul on many issues, but to say that he is simply advocating a libertarian / state's rights position is intellectually dishonest,' are you meaning to reference the specific issue of abortion and HR 1094, or generally it is intellectually dishonest to understand Ron Paul as 'advocating a libertarian / state's rights position'? newlinechar  newlinechar I also disagree with Ron Paul on this matter. I don't think an all-or-nothing solution exists for abortion. State's having the freedom to make their own laws presents quite a few issues as well. I think abortion is the issue that most demonstrates that more times than not government and governance will never be perfect.

&gt; Why are Barbie dolls white? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Amazingly enough, there has been a black Barbie since 1968! (I didn't know this before.) According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie#Controversies): 'The first African American doll in the Barbie range is usually regarded as Christie, who made her debut in 1968. Black Barbie and Hispanic Barbie were launched in 1980.' Regarding another Barbie model, the article says 'as had become the custom, Mattel manufactured both a white and a black version.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So apparently there are black Barbie dolls, although I don't think that I have seen any advertised. That makes sense, though, considering that blacks are a minority and the advertisement will probably be most effective if the doll's skin color is the same as that of the majority of viewers. That brings us to your next question... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Do you think racial preferences should map to current demographics - thereby justifying a 'tyranny of the majority? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Well, whether they 'should' or not: they do. Market forces drive advertisers to follow the money. Modern advertising is a 'tyranny of the majority' with respect to ever single issue, not just race. Alternative lifestyles are not depicted in mainstream advertising, because that's not going to win customers. Race is no different. It simply doesn't make financial sense to target a minority group when there is a larger group that could be targeted for the same cost - and advertisers can't be expected to take financial losses in order to make ads that represent minority cultures, lifestyles, and races. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This situation has the effect of portraying majority lifestyles/cultures/races/etc. in glamorous circumstances, with no corresponding portrayals of minority groups. This has the effect of correlating racial preferences with current demographics. I don't see how this can be avoided. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And getting away from the dolls for a bit, do you think that there's continuing racism in today's culture? Do you think it shapes preferences? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes and yes. **That doesn't mean that giving this outrageously unscientific study 300 upvotes is the right thing to do about it.** newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Sorry about the tremendously long post.

A stronger reason to disagree with it would be the legitimacy of its rule. The basic idea is that no country has a *right* to exist.

This is because it controls the Palestinian territories, but the people living there have no rights to change the Israeli government.

Present day power plants derive most of their power from U238, not U235.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, present day nuclear plants include heavy water CANDUs which can burn Thorium with minimal modification.

One flaw in the reasoning in this video is the idea that the planets are formed by impacts from small bodies that come from random directions, and all with the same momentum. The spin of the planets is because they are formed by collisions among smaller bodies that are already rotating around the Sun. Loosely speaking, they transfer their rotation to the forming planet. Of course, there is a degree of randomness in this, so a collision with a particularly large body, as you expect towards the end of the formation of the planets, can significantly alter the rotation rate and axis of a planet, at random. This would explain the anomalous rotation of Venus, or Uranus. It's interesting that we can observe this process happening around another star, Beta Pictoris, which is surrounded by a spinning disk of debris, and where a [violent collision](http://www.gemini.edu/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=117) between orbiting bodies has happened recently. newlinechar  newlinechar The four large moons of Jupiter (the Galilean moons) are thought to have formed together with Jupiter, out of a disk of material spinning around the planet, like the larger nebula spun around the protosun. They orbit Jupiter in the same direction, as expected. Other moons are small, irregular bodies, wandering planetesimals in fact, captured by Jupiter's gravity. These would have approached Jupiter originally from random directions, so they would not be expected to orbit the planet in the same direction.  newlinechar  newlinechar The statement that the gas giants could not have formed spontaneously because gas dissipates into space is ludicrous. The giant planets' gravity is quite sufficient to retain hydrogen atmospheres. The terrestrial planets, on the other hand, are much smaller and their gravitational pull is weaker, and they can't retain hydrogen. Mercury can't even retain any atmosphere at all. Our planets can retain thin atmospheres of heavier gases - fortunately for us! newlinechar  newlinechar The statement that the Moon's composition is very dissimilar to the Earth's is just plain wrong. In fact, the composition of the Moon is remarkably similar to the Earth's crust. The favored theory of the formation of the Moon is by an impact with a large body. [Computer simulations](http://www.swri.org/press/impact.htm) show how the Moon forms out of the debris ejected from the Earth by the impact. newlinechar  newlinechar The formation of the solar system is a fascinating story, built up from observations of the dynamics of planetary motion, analysis of meteorites, and of course more recently, exploration by spacecraft, and in the case of the Moon, by humans too. It's a much more interesting story than the creationist magical fantasy. 
If you're going to tell me the poor in Asian countries of similar economic status (not many of them! Africa is far worse off.) don't resort to whatever it takes, you're wrong.

We're talking about places where you can't even get a job in sweatshops. While places like Indonesia are poor, they have economies that are at least moving money and creating lousy jobs.

I did actually like the IDE, I just felt I needed the obligatory Microsoft is evil comment. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm working in Flash (version 8) at the moment. Now that's an evil IDE.

It also fails to pick up anything remotely useful (no type checking) however it will try and tell my that my class names conflict with themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar When compiling, the publisher will compile the code last (after all graphical resources, etc). So even if you have a simple 'Hello World' project you may be waiting half a minute find you got a type wrong.

'Every church has its oddities if you dig for them.'  Actually, you don't need to dig for them any more than you need to dig into the bible to determine that god hates fags.  All these religious groups like to flaunt the word of their god as the absolute truth, until it makes them look silly or prejudiced.  Then it's suddenly 'open to interpretation'.  Even though god made it clear in his bible that his word is NOT open to interpretation, they do it anyway.  I hear stuff like 'well, when the bible was written, such and such was the standard'.  So you're telling me that God could not predict the future?  He was careful enough to fool us all by giving evidence that the universe is billions of years old, but he didn't foresee that in today's society we couldn't take our children out and stone them to death for being disrespectful.  This implies that God made an error.  Basically, to omit certain facts or interpret things differently in the bible is flat out blasphemy.  They're saying that certain parts of the book they define their beliefs from are wrong, the ones they don't like or don't want to be associated with, but the rest is 100% factual, because god said so.  And honestly, none of this matters to me in terms of how electable someone is.  But when they make their religion a cornerstone of their political campaign, it does matter to me.  He brought his religion into this matter.  He needs to explain to everyone why he thinks he has holy underwear, and why black people were inferior until the 70's...

Yeah, that's what I was thinking. The inside of the nose has direct neurological access to the brain.

One should take a moment of peace and read the angry, anal, comments on this story to understand something about the American majority as it is mirrored in reddit. Anyone knows that votes on sites like reddit, digg etc, aren't a scientific representation of anything, and are usually arbitrary pieces of information, false or true, floating about (and sometimes reaching some kind of consensus on the main page). Everyone surfs, everyone enjoys the free spirit of digging sites, until it comes to some kind of political item that threatens their own worldly view. Only then people become statistics experts, analysts and mathematicians of what's true and what's false. One has to wonder why. Here's my guess: because those pieces threaten people's moral scales, because it makes them wonder, whether the entire chain of events and recent history of their country isn't right. Just then, instead of facing the music, they step out of the conversation, and declare 'BS', a statistical lie, and so forth. Deny deny deny

&gt;I disagree. The war on drugs has not and cannot succeed because the general population wants drugs and will do whatever it takes to get them. The general population doesn't want guns - at least not in the same sense. To the extent that the average person might want a gun, it is (to a large extent) to defend themselves against someone else with a gun. Sure, there are hunters and the like, but they are not the overwhelming majority of gun owners. But drug users want drugs whether you or I have them or not. It is not a self fulfilling cycle. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm curious to your reply of my statement: newlinechar  newlinechar There are more gun owners than illegal drug users in America. You probably think more people want drugs because you affiliate yourself with people who want drugs. If I go to the range I am going to find that 10/10 people there would rather have guns than weed. Your response was not factual or based on any hard evidence. Recent polls show that there are 83 to 96 guns for each 100 Americans. newlinechar  newlinechar ( http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0709-03.htm ) I doubt that drug use or desire for legalized drug use is anywhere near what gun ownership rates are. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I submit that if you think all US citizens have the right to own and carry guns for your own protection, then you should agree that every nation has the right to nuclear weapons for the very same reason. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Do you agree or disagree and why? newlinechar  newlinechar 'Mutually assured destruction' has been keeping countries from nuking each other since the early years of the atom bomb. The only time an atom bomb was used against another country as a weapon of war was when America used it against Japan. We also happened to be the only people in the world in possession of the bomb. At that point in time, the only nukes that existed were the ones we were dropping on Japan. Despite the massive proliferation of arms that occured during the cold war, we never nuked each other. Amazing! Of course I am for sovereign nations being able to arm themselves with nuclear weapons! Why shouldn't they be able to? What keeps the haves from breaking the rules and nuking the have-nots? Sure, the have-nots may have allies who will fight on their behalf, but what is the point when their entire population has been wiped off of the map? newlinechar  newlinechar Do you ever wonder why we have shootings in malls, schools, and churches? Well, I sure as hell don't hear much about shootings happening at gun shows or in police stations! Maybe it's the fact that our schools and most public places have had put up signs that say 'This is a gun free zone.' To a medicated nutcase, this says 'You can shoot as many people as you want because nobody will shoot back and it will take the SWAT team hours to finally make entry, but by then you'll have killed yourself, so happy hunting!' newlinechar

EDIT: [Sylvan summarizes it up real well](http://reddit.com/info/62qeq/comments/c02n8y1) newlinechar  newlinechar ----- newlinechar  newlinechar Males and females have different reproductive strategies. newlinechar  newlinechar Women benefit the most from being selective and restrictive. Biologically, they are motivated to get the absolute best quality male they can. That has translated to a socio-cultural tradition that women who aren't sufficiently selective, who don't reserve their fertility for a high-quality and committed male are of lower value; and conversely that any male who coerces or takes advantage of a female is violating her interest in waiting for the best she can get. newlinechar  newlinechar Women have a lot to lose from having sex with the 'wrong' male: years of childcare, and possible social ostracizing. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, males benefit from being sexually aggressive and prolific, and are biologically driven to mate as often as possible with as many women as possible. We can sire offspring then move on to the next woman. That's not the whole of the story of course: humans are mostly monogamous; it's natural for us to select a long-term mating partner and take part in raising children, increasing their chances of survival. But we have very little to lose either from promiscuity or infidelity. newlinechar  newlinechar So, different societal views of relationships between adults and teenage boys or girls aren't necessarily sexist or unfair. An independent, adult woman should absolutely be able to choose her partners freely just as a man can; and teenagers of either gender should be protected against men or women abusing positions of authority or trust to take advantage of them. newlinechar  newlinechar But where a young person willingly engages in sex or a relationship with an older person, whether that relationship is abuse or not can very much depend on the genders of the participants, in addition to their individual maturity &amp; personalities. Where a teen boy may be fully willing and unconcerned with consequences, a teen girl may experience deeper internal conflicts, and face much more serious consequences in life from such an affair. newlinechar  newlinechar -----
Since when do adults know what's best for their long term interests?  Let alone what's best for someone *else's* long term interests.

Like John Dvorak, he's a professional troll.  It's his job to draw outrage.
As an embittered victim of exactly this process, I believe I have a little insight into this process.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The goals that these kids have are many and varied, but many involve a graduate degree, and graduate school is vastly easier to get into if you attend the right undergraduate school. This is particularly true in CS, where graduate schools frequently *only* accept students from a handful of schools, with almost none coming from anywhere else (aside from international students). CS is an extreme case, but many top graduate schools, as well as law and medical schools also have this phenomenon to some degree.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So these people are rightfully stressed out about getting in. It's not something wrong with them that causes this. Instead, I fault the admissions departments at the top universities they're trying to get into. Admissions departments provide applications chock full of lists of line-item activities, the clear implication being that you are at a disadvantage if you can't overflow the lists with your many and varied 'extracurricular activities.' And the people who get in bear this out: every classmate I know who got into an Ivy had a nauseating number of useless, meaningless extracurriculars that they didn't care about.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar They select for things like 'community service' and sports and high school grades. By selecting for this, they cause the stressed-out overachievers to concentrate on meaningless activities.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My solution would be to change the criteria. First, throw out every dedicated admissions officer. None of them know anything other than how to make bullshit meaningless criteria. Split admissions departments into admissions for each area of study (engineering, science, humanities, etc), and staff each department with professors from that area of study. Professors know their area, and so they will recognize when applicants do something remarkable in that area, where dedicated admissions officers, clueless about every particular field, will be blind to achievements in any kind of technical field.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Then, change the criteria so that the most important thing is to have done something remarkable (an art project, a programming project, a history paper, an english paper, an engineering project) in the area being applied for. A report on or submission of that remarkable thing should be the central aspect of the application.
Rebuttals: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Emacs is also very widely installed.

That's not an argument for either emacs or vi. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 3. Both editors have lots of users, so this shouldn't sway you much.

Good point.  I suppose that's the idea behind Montessori education: give children access to many different interesting things to learn and allow them to choose.  That way, if they don't enjoy one thing, there are other equally stimulating things available.  However, that approach ensures that the kids are still doing something to improve their minds no matter what they choose.  I doubt anyone looks back on their life and says 'I wish I'd played more video games.'

&gt; I'm intrigued-given that you seem to think fetuses have some sort of personhood-would you support banning drug/alcohol/tobacco use in expectant mothers? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Its probably a good idea, as drug/alcohol/tobacco use can end up really messing a baby up. I'm sure there are medical limits as to what will and won't affect an infant in the womb, and that's probably where the legal restrictions should be set. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Should they be forbidden to engage in athletic activities that would tend to induce miscarriage? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That's a good question. As far as I know, there's never been restrictions on stuff like that before. I know when my mother had my younger brother, her doctor made her stay in bed for like the last 9 weeks of her pregnancy. That really comes down to a judgement call. I'm not sure that women should be legally restricted from engaging in physical activities while pregnant (maybe certain ones), but not all women are the same and different physical actions will affect their pregnancies differently. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There's not any question about it when it comes to abortion.

Why, because someone compiled a list of the worst geographic and cultural misunderstandings perpetrated by Americans? Why, exactly, does not knowing much about the rest of the world make me dumb?

If women have the choice to abort, then the men have the choice to support financially?  That seems to make sense.  Making it really a two party decision.

I've used both AutoCAD and Sketchup. They are quite different. SketchUp is really for sketching - it actually has a specific  tool to fuzzify lines to make them look handdrawn! It is super fast and is based on spatial constraints - similar to Sutherland's work on SketchPad in the early 1960's, but not as general and powerful.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar AutoCAD is far more 'coordinate' based - you have a lot more fine control and more options, plus of course AutoLISP and other code... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar On a day to day basis I would prefer SketchUp.

I'm only mildly curious about zen/zazen/mediation.  However, people who are only curious about something are more likely to read the comments to *find out* whether the article is likely to interest them.  In fact, that's why I read the first few comments before actually reading the article. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That said, it does sound like you are vigorously disagreeing with the article, and yet unwilling to say why, which is very like trolling. :) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In any case, the article seems to be saying that zen is the opposite of everything I aim for in life, so I thought it was interesting and a good pointer of what to avoid until I've done/learned all the interesting things (i.e., forever).
Yeah.  I've been a professional programmer for many, many years, and the *only* times that I've ever seen *anything* about lines-of-code as a metric, it has been some programmer writing an article about what a stupid measure it is, and how managers are stupid for caring about it, and stupid stupid stupid. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I've never actually been asked how many lines I produce, or anything remotely similar to that.  In fact, I don't even have a vague idea of how many lines I produce. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I've come to the conclusion that all these articles are by people who've never actually worked professionally as programmers, and are projecting their imaginations of how horrible actual work must be into their absurd and uninformed articles.
As of now, there is no distinction between link relevance and quality, which is [one of the top feature requests](http://features.reddit.com/info?id=27b9) on reddit. The trouble is that the solution proposed there -- clicking a link is an up-vote for relevance -- is too implicit: you have to worry about whether or not to click a link, and there's no way to take it back. Also see RFC 2616, [Sec. 9](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html).1.1  :) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Hiding a link does not have this disadvantage. You could hide links you're not interested in, and only down-vote 'bad' links, e.g. those that are wrong, flamebait, or spam. This would solve the problem of links getting buried only because the people who would have been interested in them just didn't happen upon them in time.
No, the reason to believe that there is something more than the logic allows are clues that rationality has severe problems with handling phenomena which exist, but cannot be defined or approached. newlinechar  newlinechar These are amongst others humor, taste and any kind of art. If you can come up with a scientifically firm theory of these phenomena I am eager to hear.
I'm not sure if people 'self censored' deliberately or if there was a 'this work is mine,  I only submit stuff I'm proud of' thing happening. I've discussed this with faculty and the older ones have a really strong 'less publications of better quality' and the younger ones have a 'everything that contributes to my c.v., even in a small way, is good' mentality. Sure, I'm blatantly generalizing, but at least in the earth sciences there has been a huge decline in quality accompanied by a huge increase in the number of journals. Of course, there is a corresponding request-for-papers-for-midlevel-journals trend too, because they need to keep those journals full. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Journal publications are explicitly ranked by search committees for positions, and by grant committees. Everyone knows what the first-rank, second-rank, and not-so-good journals are in a field. Sure, some great papers show up in the not-so-good journals. The converse is even more true - a lot of 'same old, same old' conservative papers show up in the second rank journals.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with some of the earlier comments that there is a 'old boys' network phenomenon here, though I would argue that it is an 'old comfortable ideas' phenomenon - people want to be challenged a bit, not a lot, and they certainly don't want papers out that cast their _own_ historic papers into questionable light. And this WILL happen - new research will make perfectly honest 'old' research either 'irrelevant' or 'invalid in new context.' So there is a social bias against really revolutionary work.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think that science (not science journals, not editors of science journals, not...) would be well served if everyone was told 'okay, you can only submit two articles for peer review per year as first author, and two more as anything OTHER than first author.' Before you scream that these numbers are too low, remember that most of the famous scientists historically didn't submit ANYWHERE NEAR this number and remember as well that spending ten hours on a project perhaps shouldn't result in being listed as an author (even fifth...). And yes, these rules are the rules I apply to myself. And I have no shortage of research grants.... etc... so obviously it wasn't a 'fatal decision' to make. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I spend a fair amount of time doing peer reviews and doing grant selection work and I can honestly say that 75% of what I see is not a credit to those who did the work. I've gotten harsher in recent months because the flow of sewage is increasing. Sigh. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

This is an insightful article.  His criticisms of the Democrat position on the ports deal is especially warranted.

You act as though having many old theories replaced by new theories is something unique to economics, when this is actually how the scientific method works.  I mean, with any historical prospective, ALL sciences are this way.  Planetary motion is the most obvious example.  Ptolemy had a theory for the motion of the planets, which was replaced by Copernicus, which was replaced by Kepler, which was replaced by Newton, which was replaced by Einstein.  There will ALWAYS be progress with revision in science as theories and models approach and converage on 'the truth.'  It is also important to realize the the formal study of economics is relatively young, and is still growing.  It's a bit unfair to compare it to physics, which is arguably the oldest science.
Wow, that is truly awful.

The fact remains that Chavez does not understand economics. He's imposed [price controls](http://africa.reuters.com/odd/news/usnN30300735.html) and now even toilet paper is short.

Us atheists actually take all your holy books at face value.  newlinechar  newlinechar When your holy book says that god created a man and a woman 6,000 years ago we know that is not correct and therefore your religion is likely bunk. newlinechar  newlinechar When we read that your god-man rose from the dead just like pagan Osiris, Dionysus, Horus, Mithra and countless others we assume it was a myth. newlinechar  newlinechar Likewise when we read that your prophet raped a nine year old child there is no good excuse for that passage to be there. If your apologetics were true then the passage would have mentioned that the marriage was 'only officially consummated' or that the prophet refuted the story to his followers. As it stands right now all those hadiths confirm that Muhammad was a pedophile regardless of the amount of spin you throw at us.  newlinechar  newlinechar We atheists don't discriminate on the basis of religion. We treat all your holy books as equally despicable as any one who objectively reads them must do so. We just let those texts speak for themselves because we have no emotional investment in them.

To be fair, the original conquest of the city by the Sassayids was a massacre, too, and I'll bet that memories of that were used to motivate the Christians 400 years later.

Here's the fundamental issue with 'Public Domain' and GPL: newlinechar  newlinechar With public domain you are free to use the code for commercial applications with out either having to recognize the author/project or make your modifications/implementation public. newlinechar  newlinechar With the GPL, you can use for profit, but you must share.  People seem to forget the entire idea behind the GPL is to improve software by sharing the code with a much larger community of developers without the fear of legal retribution.  Public domain release does not accomplish this critical goal. newlinechar  newlinechar The GPL is a software improvement process more than it is a legal framework for licensing software.  Either you get that, or you're forever lost in the woods. newlinechar  newlinechar And yes, as soon as a project is released to the public domain, the smartest thing to do is put it in a GPL wrapper from which all further development should proceed.  Now, questions is: will current and future patch submitters recognize the wisdom of this move? newlinechar  newlinechar Releasing to public domain was just the original author's way of sending a big old 'fsck you' to the GPL community (his dislike of GPL is widely known/openly stated and the reason why he eventually had to let go).  Postfix kicked qmails ass quite some time ago, but I really don't want to digress into the gory details of why and how that happened (but, yes, to some degree, it directly relates to how each project decided to license their software)

I think the comment may have been misunderstood. newlinechar  newlinechar In my mind a 'lulzer' is someone overly fond of griefing others.  One thing they do is mock people who take anything seriously on the net.  They use this belittling of net communication to mistakenly absolve themselves of culpability for their assholery. newlinechar  newlinechar I am _far_ from the position of believing that just because something is conveyed via the net it is not important.  I know that the net is just another communication channel. newlinechar  newlinechar So, I'm saying that this situation is a great example of how net communication can have serious, real-life impact, and should be remembered as proof against lulzer dismissal.

&gt; I can understand how it appears otherwise. The context of my message is particularly damning newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not really offended by it, and I'm glad it was a mistake. newlinechar  newlinechar Btw, you may want to read about [postfix mail disasters](http://cr.yp.to/maildisasters/postfix.html) if you're interested in that sort of thing. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Maybe you can entice me by telling me a bit about the features in the set that's uniquely provided for you by qmail. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know if I can. newlinechar  newlinechar For local delivery, the `dot-qmail` formats and protocols are unique. They allow users to specify mail delivery instructions without being programmers. newlinechar  newlinechar For outgoing mail, the modularity of qmail makes it easy to have multiple queues and wire up smtpd so that it injects the message into a specific queue based on some criteria. This feature I believe is only supported natively by MMDF, but MMDF has an even lower penetration than Qmail. I have scripts that modify the rates of these queues based on other network activities. newlinechar  newlinechar I can expire messages at different rates based on different criterions, which makes it easier to deliver *relevant* error reporting to my relay users. newlinechar  newlinechar My `qmail-remote` checks the outgoing IP for common rbls so that even if I get a 4xx or 5xx error, I can estimate if it is rbl-related and try a different source address. This way, my customer's don't lose mail.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are other things, but they either fall in the category of the modularity being extremely useful for inspection, diagnostic, and extension for sites large enough to need some serious voodoo, but not so large that they're Yahoo! newlinechar  newlinechar If you're comfortable with postfix's source code, and cutting into it to handle hundreds of millions of messages per month, then qmail offers you very little *functionally*. Of course, the qmail source hasn't changed in 10 years, so you don't have to 'resync' with an upstream. Not having to edit config files for 10 years is *really* nice. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You must be happy with the new licensing. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know yet. If qmail gets more contributors because of this then I'll be happy, but the fact is that Qmail is pretty feature-complete, and has been for 10 years. I really don't know what anyone can do with it. On the other hand, maybe qmail-local will get a procmail wrapper so Postfix can use it, so maybe this'll be good for postfix.

&gt;All that said, if something is a blatant lie (ie 'I said x' when we have them saying y on video) needs to be brought to attention, front and center. newlinechar  newlinechar That's all we can reasonably expect, I think. But the story in question is a perfect example of such a lie, and still no one called them on it. newlinechar  newlinechar This mindset is the reason why Creationism is taken seriously in America. People are so used to understanding everything in terms of two equally valid viewpoints that they can't understand anything more complex than 'Perspective A' versus 'Perspective B.' They both must have good points! It would be hasty to put the blame for this on the media, but I'd say it's an extremely likely candidate.
Alright, I mean basic stuff here.  Art. I, § 8: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives. newlinechar  newlinechar That is, Congress may enact and repeal legislation, not the president.  In particular, Art. 6, cl. 2: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This Constitution, and *the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof*; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, *shall be the supreme Law of the Land*; . . . (emphasis mine) newlinechar  newlinechar It is not the president's prerogative whether or not to enforce valid law.  Is it valid law?  I can't attest to whether it was duly enacted, but the income tax (notwithstanding individual details) passes constitutional muster, by Art. I, § 8, cl. 1, and Amendment 16. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know how much the executive can avoid doing without being in breach of acts of Congress, but I strongly suspect that not collecting income tax is not a legally sustainable position.  That's why I argue that were the IRS abolished, some entity would have to be empowered to take its place. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm ready to be convinced otherwise, because I'm very curious how you'd go about this.

I agreed with the idea that history creates a social framework. Current affairs create their own frameworks: see my racial profiling example. My point was that we as a society make directed efforts to change said frameworks (if we agree they cause social turmoil and/or injustice) through social pressure and by enacting laws. Certainly black americans ancestors suffered and word usage that mirrors that of the period is offensive. This still doesn't negate the fact that describing someone who isn't black by their skin color is generally derogatory.  newlinechar When I'm called a white boy in my neighborhood it isn't meant affectionately. Sorry they don't get a pass and neither do black comedians. newlinechar  newlinechar If I called a black man a black man it would have more possible layers of meaning. So what? newlinechar  newlinechar 'We all understand that it's OK for a black man to use the term 'nigga,'' newlinechar  newlinechar Here I disagree. No one owns history. I think the word is offensive. Of course growing up in a rural town with a few black friends (the only black people in town) has probably made me sensitive.

Even Adam Smith argued that there would be market failures where certain firms would gain control of too many of a societies resources and therefor no longer be acting under free market principles. Jefferson was a smart guy and he understood the same thing. newlinechar  newlinechar Until last year I was like you, so over the top libertarian I thought you shouldn't limit anyone ever. Then I was forced in college to debate AGAINST walmart, I thought it'd be a joke but I ended up reading adam smith and saying 'wow, this guy was right, this really ISN'T a free market and it really isn't ok.' newlinechar  newlinechar There are certain times when monopolies are inevitable, or even 'good'. A good thing to do in this situation is to limit those monopolies, not necessarily in size but in operation. Free markets are efficient because they produce were P = MC, it's not too hard to figure out ways to get monopolies to act similarly. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, if you're interested, read some of Adam Smith's own writings on market flaws. It's really interesting! These guys (smith, jefferson, etc) predicted EXACTLY what was going to happen to our society in such amazing detail and accuracy. Corporations, central banks, misguided foreign wars, giving up rights for safety, I mean it all ties together so beautifully and its PRECISELY what they all warned us against - telling us HOW and WHY it would happen, yet we let it happen.

'The very word 'secrecy' is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.

This is my biggest fear.  Although Paul has now successfully out raised every other candidate, it is not reflecting well in the polls (He's growing yes, but not exploding like he should be).  People still don't know who he is and I assume he's not getting much airtime on MSM.  Every time MSM mentions news of 'the candidates' they show Hillary, Obama, Rudy, and Romney.  Its subliminal, but it works.  Anyone else is not really taken seriously because they aren't 'a candidate'.  Then again, I haven't seen a poll for NH since he started TV advertising and was at 8%. newlinechar  newlinechar I have a few suggestions of what I think might help, so I'll spell them out and take any feedback: newlinechar  newlinechar -Advertise in the newspapers around here (NH).  I read the Eagle Tribune and I never see him mentioned*. newlinechar  newlinechar -Spend money in the forgotten states.  States like NY and MA have lots of delegates and yet they are not paid attention to because by the time they get to vote, all candidates have dropped out and the parties have made up their minds.  These voters are DYING for attention.  If you just mention somebody's name it could be worth a vote.  In addition, by spending money in these states you force Romney and Guiliani spend money in their own states too.  I don't think this is something that they would have planned for.  If they start slipping in the Polls to Dr. Paul, it could make them look weak as leaders.  This also has the spillover effect because people in the early states have many friends and relatives in the late states.  I think a good advertisement for a politician would be on the LIRR or subway with a few of his issues.  I always find myself staring at interesting advertising for a long time because theres nothing else to look at. newlinechar  newlinechar -Tout military donations and record-breaking fund raising in advertisements.  I think many people still view Dr. Paul as a fringe candidate because they don't know anyone who's voting for him!  People like to follow the crowd, so make sure they know the crowd is voting for Paul. newlinechar  newlinechar -Dr. Paul - It couldn't hurt to show pics of him delivering a baby.  People love that. newlinechar  newlinechar -Go to supermarkets and public places and hand out copies of his writings.  I've read that stuff, and its damn good.  Take out an advertisement and run it in the paper.  I'll throw down for that.  If anyone does this make sure you put his phone number (1-877-RON-PAUL) on the material.  Old people hate technology. newlinechar  newlinechar *The one time I heard Paul mentioned in the Tribune was from a comment that the early republican debates were too crowded, and the columnist said 'he would wait for fringe candidates without a chance like Ron Paul to drop out.'

If all the plain text document contains is the name of the candidate, then it would be trivial for someone else to try all the names of the candidates and find which one matches the hash. You could add extra text, but since no one can know what that text is ahead of time, you could theoretically play with that text to create a planned collision just the same as they used the structure of PDF to do here.

&gt; 'As disastrous as Iraq has been, an attack on Iran could engulf America in a war with the entire Muslim world.' newlinechar  newlinechar No. Iran is Shia and most of the Muslim world couldn't give a damn outside of their own interests.

Wait, wait... a fetus has **what** in common with a fully formed human being? newlinechar  newlinechar There's no head. newlinechar  newlinechar There's no torso. newlinechar  newlinechar There's no ears, eyes, nose. No hair, no spinal column, no brainstem, no brain. newlinechar  newlinechar At six weeks, there's nothing that you could use to tell, with your naked eye, that this is a fetus. newlinechar  newlinechar And you want to tell me that this has the same rights as an adult? newlinechar  newlinechar There is DNA. If the woman consents to allow the fetus to grow, there is the potential for life. But that potential for life was there insider of her body before she was fertilized - the potential for life belongs to the mother, not to the fetus. newlinechar  newlinechar As the fetus comes to have awareness - certainly by six months - then we can begin to discuss this as a matter of two people, and talk of rights. newlinechar  newlinechar But at six weeks? It's inappropriate to accord a six fetus 'human' rights, because it is not a human, any more than a sperm or an egg are human.

I don't think that's an armadillo.  Yeah, it kinda looks like one, sort-of, if you really use your imagination.

I've focused more on the writing rather than on the pictures and whatnot, especially during the 'naked women in bathtubs' portion. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And yeah, there's sweet-potato-looking things and a sunflower-looking thing, and a couple of other plants which appear to be new-world plants. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The main reasons that I doubt your explorer/native theory are twofold: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1.) The naked women appear to have European hair styles and features.  Granted, the drawings are a bit crude; however, if you compare them to 16th century Native American artwork, it's all wrong.  They look much more similar to the stylings of European artwork dating between the 14th (or earlier) and 16th century (though considerably more crude, perhaps).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 2.) Your theory raises too many questions: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar - Why would an explorer encode all of this information?   newlinechar  newlinechar - Why would this unknown explorer not have passed his encoding method on to whoever he sold or gave the book to?   newlinechar  newlinechar - If he was murdered and the book was stolen, then surely the killer would have either noticed the book was in code prior to the murder and not murder him, or instead would have forced either the explorer or his scribe to give the decryption key prior to doing it.   newlinechar  newlinechar - If the explored died of some other, natural or accidental cause, then why were the secrets of the completed book never sold for fame and/or fortune? newlinechar  newlinechar - Even if he was encoding some of the information in the book, why would he bother encoding his star charts?  Assuming he needed them for navigation, shouldn't he have had that information readily available for his crew in case of emergency?  If he didn't need them for navigation, then what would be the point of putting them in the book to begin with?  The stars look the same to everyone, and it was already known that different stars were visible in the south than in the north. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Just a few off the top of my head. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's also my personal belief that the text predates Columbus.  Honestly, I don't have a great deal of basis for this belief... might just be wishful thinking on my part.  Even if there are, in fact, new-world plants and/or animals pictured/described in the book (which I could go either way on), I'd still hold that theory.  I mean... it's not like Columbus actually *discovered* America.

Yeah same here. In fact, the more I learn about how our elections work, the more disgusted I get. I went to a mock caucus in Nevada, and the entire process is ridiculous.

&gt;(Edit: I see some of you are down-voting RobertIsBell now. When I posted, he had 5 points. He only has 2 now because I up-voted him. Please don't abuse the Reddit moderation system by down-voting people you disagree with. It prevents free discussion. Thank you.) newlinechar  newlinechar I think the reddit moderation system is inherently flawed/quasi-broken. newlinechar  newlinechar *Down* means 'offensive', 'spammy', 'inane-beyond-reason', but what does *Up* mean? It's sort of 'good point', 'interesting take on the issue' or 'I would've said the same, so I reinforce the point'. newlinechar  newlinechar All of the up meanings essentially boil down to 'I agree'. Save for the (actually most important) 'interesting take', although, given human psychology, I'd say that this point doesn't really change a thing: people will hesitate to upmod comments they disagree with, the only difference this upmod-reason makes is that people usually not bothering to rate will do so. Also, even if you think or intend to mod reasonable, it's easy to rationalize in some way or another: 'why, I don't really downmod *RobertIsbell*, but I don't think his comment deserves 5 points, either; maybe four or three or so'. newlinechar  newlinechar And your upmod was chivalrous, but was it a genuine, a good upmod? I often stumble upon comments where I think to myself, Well, I disagree with that, etc., but I don't think it deserves to be downmodded at all, let alone into oblivion. What to do? Pity-upmod or not? newlinechar  newlinechar I think It's just a mistake to group these buttons together; they have nothing to do with each other, but the symbolism/analogy/grouping encourage 'misuse'. newlinechar  newlinechar *Down* is *Report*. *Up* is *Like*, or *Recommend*.

We are a service economy mostly based on having an educated population.

Yeah, same here. As far as I'm concerned type classes are objects. If I can't create a new string type and use it in built-in libraries that expect strings, I don't consider it OO. Incidentally, you can't do this with CLOS or other 'advanced' object systems (basically the ones with multiple dispatch).[1] newlinechar  newlinechar [1] Yes, I'm aware of closures. However, requiring somebody to use closures for this is essentially exposing an implementation detail, _and_ it's more effort. You have to accept each and every possible 'method' function that you might need as a parameter, and you're screwed if something changes.

I think that it is crazy to completely vilify George Bush in this manner. Low fidelity is a major cause (or at least aggravating factor) in the spread of AIDS in Africa.  newlinechar  newlinechar A good approach is a two-step approach – be faithful to a single partner but use condoms when you have sex (as far as I know, this was the policy of the Bush government). As far as I know, this approach resulted in a decrease in AIDS in Uganda.  newlinechar  newlinechar It is easy to blame George Bush(1) for everything, but there are two much larger villains whom the world is silent about: “Dr” [Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manto_Tshabalala-Msimang) and president [Thabo Mbeki]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thabo_Mbeki). The first is health minister of the country with the largest number of people with AIDS(SA), and the second is its president. newlinechar  newlinechar Dr. Manto believes that Beetroot and Garlic is a better cure for AIDS than antiretroviral medicine. She made sure that her competent deputy health minister got fired, because of her dissenting (i.e. correct) views on AIDS. newlinechar  newlinechar Mr. Mbeki refuses to admit that there is a link between  AIDS and HIV.  newlinechar  newlinechar It would have been interesting if the headline read: newlinechar &gt; Mbeki has the bald-faced audacity to claim that HIV does not cause AIDS.   newlinechar  newlinechar Both Mbeki and Manto have a much larger effect on the lives of people living with AIDS than an American president 10000 miles away. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar (1) It is fair to blame him for Iraq, the price of oil, fucking up the USA economy and trying to build a death star.

I don't think the Ninth Amendment really does it.  Let's take a look at the text: newlinechar  newlinechar The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. newlinechar  newlinechar So the relevant question we have to decide here is whether a right to personal privacy was a right 'retained by the people.'  Now you can argue “yes” and you can argue “no,” but where you come down on that argument really depends on how you interpret the Constitution. newlinechar  newlinechar Small Footnote: We are now getting into the area of what makes Roe so interesting, from a legal scholar’s perspective.  Unfortunately, the blithering idiots of the pro-choice and pro-life movements have robbed the public of the ability to discuss the grace and nuance of the legal arguments presented on behalf of both sides.  This is unfortunate.  Anyway, moving on . . .  newlinechar  newlinechar There is a group of Constitutional scholars out there called originalists that think the Constitution is essentially a contract or treaty between the states, which gives them certain powers.  Now this concept of a contract, or treaty, is important because the way one would normally interpret the force and effect of a contract or treaty is according to the meaning of the terms at the time the contract or treaty was written. newlinechar  newlinechar So for an originalist, interpreting a right to privacy, in both birth control pills and abortion, is fairly simple.  The Founding Fathers had no concept of the pill or (arguably) of abortion.  Therefore the language of the Constitution doesn’t contemplate those acts.  They are not “covered” under the Bill of Rights.  Since they were unknown at the time the Constitution was written, they couldn’t have fallen into the category of rights “retained by the people.”   newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, you may fall into the category of those who believe in the Constitution as a “living document.”  In this camp, you would argue that maybe the founding fathers didn’t KNOW about the pill or abortion, but if they HAD, they would probably not have wanted state governments interfering with the right, OR that the founding fathers developed a set of underlying GUIDELINES for the protection of individual rights, and we think “X” falls into those.  There are, of course, some real interpretational problems with the living document theory.  Compare it with the penumbras: Instead of sticking our hand up the Constitution’s butt to make it say what we want, we are now sticking our hand up the respective derriers of the founding fathers, saying what they WOULD HAVE SAID.  How the hell do we know? newlinechar  newlinechar I think there are good and bad aspects of both methods of interpretation.  I would, however, like to point out that we can always AMEND the Constitution if it doesn’t say what we think it should.  Perhaps we should amend it more often, instead of leaving it to the whims of the court to develop convenient penumbras.

On the other hand, the Constitution set the stage for un-original-intent federal power grabs, which we desperately need to roll back (enter Ron Paul, stage right).  In addition to rolling back these power-grabs, I think we also need to introduce some more democratizing effects, like limiting the Presidents' power even further, maybe dissolving the senate in favor of a unicameral system, etc. (not completely sure on these topics though, I'm no political scientist).

Every shred of evidence so far says that they have not done this -- in fact, he garners so little attention from his own party that he can't crack double digits in the polls. newlinechar  newlinechar And this isn't the result of a conspiracy to keep frontrunners in front. Mike Huckabee was a who-dat second-tier candidate for the Republican nom. He's in the lead in the most recent Rasmussen polls. So the problem is not a media conspiracy. newlinechar  newlinechar What Paul is doing with fundraising is remarkable, but it hasn't shown any net effect in his polling numbers. Votes count, not dollars. He needs to win the primary and get elected before he is anointed savior of America.

I am currently an engineering student and am finishing up a course in 'material properties'.  In this class we talked about the WTC incidents because they are a great--though tragic--real world example of how different materials react under many bad conditions.  When heated, metals (steel included) become more elastic; they become bendable and stretchy.  As was mentioned above, the building was VERY HOT from fire.  My professor also said that NYC was using WTC7 as a storage facility for emergency fuel (gasoline).  All this burning causes the buildings strength as a whole to be GREATLY reduced, until there is a failure.  This failure occurs at the point of greatest stress--the base of the building.  Take away the base floors of the building, and the rest will fall straight down.  Any engineer with materials experience could have told you that building was in trouble if they read the inside conditions on WTC7.  That is why we knew it was coming down.
I am not a troll! :)and I appreciate your response. All I ask is that .01% uncertainty. But many Atheists understand intellectually that they can not be sure that there wasn't some intelligent force behind the creation of the Universe. Most religious people(that I've met) understand intellectually that they can't prove that god exists but that somehow their belief in the face of the lack of evidence represents some strength of character or evidence in and of itself. I do not think Atheists believe this, and in that way pass the logical test, but they adopt their belief in the absence of god as simply the most practical solution to the problem, since it doesn't make any sense to concern yourself with something that has no apparent impact on your life. newlinechar  newlinechar In other words, to choose to not consider the possibility of god may be a rational decision on a day-to-day basis, saving time, headaches, and disappointment, but that doesn't mean it's logical. I do not believe anyone should call themselves an atheist unless they are *closed* to the possibility of any sort of god. There's a word for people who would be willing to change their minds faced with evidence one way or the other, Agnostics. newlinechar  newlinechar The definition of god is also a tricky, subjective thing. If our species discovers that there is, in fact, a Unifying Theory of Everything; A single equation that governs the behavior of all things in the Universe, I would feel free to call that equation God, and would I be inaccurate in so doing?

&gt; Helping and sharing are anti-free-market newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know where you got this, but it's entirely untrue.  All the free market means is that trade between individuals is not managed by a central body.  Volunteerism is certainly not shunned in a free market, in fact it would be considered a form of barter since you are exchanging your time for a potential future benefit (orderly society).  For years, this sort of thing has been screwed up by stupid economists in places like the world bank that force countries into self-destructive policies in the name of the 'free market', when in fact the very injection of aid money and goods from foreign countries hugely skews the local markets in these countries and can be considered very anti free-market. newlinechar  newlinechar

Handling multiple concurrent downloads is a terrible use case for threads.  I don't understand why it always ends up used as an example. newlinechar  newlinechar The *only* reason threads are used here is because python ships with three or so different modules for HTTP downloads, but none of them use asyncore (or similar). newlinechar  newlinechar A proper asyncore based HTTP client would make the limits for such a thing *much* higher without making the process any more complicated... I imagine the process may even be less complicated, as it is in cocoa. newlinechar  newlinechar You wouldn't have to consider locks (technically, the GIL protects, but this example code is appending to a list from multiple threads concurrently). newlinechar  newlinechar Imagine something like this: newlinechar  newlinechar     def get(url, opaque, got_bytes, got_error, finished): newlinechar        ... newlinechar  newlinechar The only remotely tricky part would be building the abstraction to limit the number of requests so they don't all happen at the same time.

I read a similar kind of DNA study about the origins of the Kurds, who it turns out are genetically very closely related to the Jews. The study theorised that the Kurds split from the Jews and moved out before the Romans took over Palestine (thereby avoiding the Roman punishment of exile meted out after the Jewish rebellion) and any traces of Judaism that remained disappeared when they later converted to Islam.

Now do you deny that the mental state of a world leader is pertinent to world affairs? And if you don't, do you still agree with your earlier description of ignorance in this context as a 'lack [of] some relevant information'? If so, how are you going to frame this to claim that a lack of some relevant information on world affairs is not equal to a lack of some relevant information on world affairs?

At the very least, he should be let go. Personally, I think the police officer should be put in jail for assault or forced to give his victim a large sum of money for such outrageous, unwarranted treatment. I understand that the guy didn't produce his license as quickly as he should have, but maybe if the officer wasn't yelling he would have been more cooperative. Everything after that, including but not limited to the tasering, is a criminal offense and the officer should be charged accordingly.
Israel argues it has occupied these territories by right of conquest in a war started by the Arabs. The Ottomans (and their Arab subjects) also occupied the territory by right of conquest, and relatively recently. So why should the Arab claim trump the Israeli claim?  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But apart from that - the Ottoman state was beaten/collapsed in World War I, after which the territory was legally occupied by the British under international mandate (aka right of conquest) and then by the UN. So it's unlikely that 'Ottoman law' would prevail in any circumstances.

Sadly my pc didn't react to well to that pdf file so I didn't get to read much of it.

It seems more a case of splitting hairs. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The Botswana 'hot spot' was smack dab in the middle of the Kalahari Desert. Very few Tswana live in the Kalahari, but I am not surprised that those that do experience a bit fewer calories than elsewhere. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Personally I find the notion that Botswana could be hungry in any meaningful sense bizarre. They can simply buy what they can't grow, similar to city folk around the world who can't grow their own find. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There are all kinds of statistics one can pull for various countries, and really screwed up countries like Egypt (finally beginning some reform by the way this year) and Libya can also do well in some categories. Especially when they get aid (dictatorship Egypt gets $3 billion a year from the US for not being a meanie to Israel) or have oil and gas resources (Libya). Also Malawi has been receiving substantial food aid for some time, I am not surprised it is on the low end of hunger. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But that is not why I linked to what I linked to. My point was that you can't blame libertarian economic failure on a country (Malawi) that didn't have even a quasi-libertarian economy.

And you're wrong too.  Your return is the interest you're not paying on that debt.  Mortgages are at what, 6-7% now?  That's your guaranteed return from paying off your mortgage.  It certainly beats T-bills, and is close to the long-term average return on the stock market. newlinechar  newlinechar If it were any debt *other* than a mortgage (including, I believe HELOCs), you can tack an additional 30-40% onto that, because pennies saved are *after tax*.

I don't understand why he thinks the first thing to do with C++ is say 'let's not use these pieces.' I think that the first thing to do with C++ is become an expert BEFORE (or in parallel with, but with heavy emphasis on getting everything right) using it for a major project, and I agree that this is less than ideal, but I don't think the answer is to throw things out. newlinechar  newlinechar OTOH, I am not sure I could come up with a large project where I wouldn't either need to switch to C because I needed every last drop of speed or be just as well off programming the damn thing in Python and writing C extensions if ever shown necessary. For example, I recently did some profiling work on KTorrent, a KDE app written in C++ with Qt, and found that after all the headache of writing the damn thing in C++, the primary speed bottleneck was SHA-1 hashing, which you can do fast in any language by calling out to OpenSSL.

I'm not sure Jquery is suitable for large web applications, at least I've never saw a big webapp based on this (I don't say, it doesn't exist). newlinechar  newlinechar My company recently released an application for SFR (a big French mobile phone company) which been entirely designed around Mootools. newlinechar  newlinechar We also add homebrew functions and a template system : http://src.masklinn.net/jsdt newlinechar  newlinechar The actual overall weight is 30 kb Gzipped+Minified. newlinechar  newlinechar I really enjoy working on this application (we were 2 guys working on that) maintenance was pretty easy, event system is very nice to make layers interact between each others (consider we were using a View/Model design, and you can plug a bunch of views on a single model) newlinechar  newlinechar Here it is : newlinechar http://www.sfr.fr/sfr-sur-mesure/souscription.jsp

I was with him until I got to this: newlinechar &gt; The goal with the timestring syntax is that positions and periods of time shall be so easy to read and write in an information-preserving syntax that there will be no need to cater to the information-losing formats preferred by some only because of their attempt at similarity to their spoken forms. newlinechar  newlinechar While I don't like having all these confusing, lossy formats either, a new, lossless format that no-one uses isn't any better.
You are partly correct. I was making a pretty bald blanket statement. Super-sized almost. But I doubt many of you would read a 10-page paper on the subject if I would have posted that here in the comments. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Most Americans don't live in a state of fear or rhetoric.  newlinechar  newlinechar Well, simple rhetoric plays a much larger part in the american political debate than it does in many other countries. newlinechar  newlinechar 'guns don't kill people, people kill people' newlinechar  newlinechar 'don't ask what you can do for your country, ask what your country can do for you' newlinechar  newlinechar 'we are fighting for our freedom' newlinechar  newlinechar It's all pretty rhetoric with no substance. Yet the are still actively part of politics, media and therefor public opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And intellectualism is not considered a bad thing.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying there is no intellectual debate. I'm just questioning how much impact that intellectual debate has on public's opinion or your governments policy. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it is far less that it is in a number of other western countries.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Our present administration is comprised of a bunch of paranoid incompetent dolts but don't make a blanket statement about all of America based on that. newlinechar  newlinechar Not all of America agrees with the policies. newlinechar  newlinechar But you are all share responsibility for creating a culture where this ends up taking place. Wether your left- or right- winged, the current policy and public opinion has little real intellectual grounding.  newlinechar  newlinechar If anything, they just talk marketing, and do something completely incomprehensible. newlinechar  newlinechar I wouldn't be able to call the current policies in the US conservative or liberal. It is neither. It seems almost random, really. Whatever fits in the slogan. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I am not even going to touch the 'car' comment. newlinechar  newlinechar It was below the belt and also a huge generalisation.  newlinechar  newlinechar What i wanted to point out though, is that in some countries, experts have a status that is not related to their income, rather it is related to their expertise. newlinechar  newlinechar In general, being the expert on a certain area, indirectly gives you more power, because people will listen and trust your judgement. newlinechar  newlinechar Public opinion is much less for sale.
That's not true at all: newlinechar  newlinechar 'Gamers understandably were wary of game makers when the Nintendo Entertainment System came out in 1985. The 10NES lockout chip solved the problem of controlling access to the console (for the most part), but there was the issue of customer confidence. So Nintendo introduced the Seal of Quality to show gamers that the games had met quality control standards in terms of basic programming and that the games would be suitable for the entire family and thus free of objectionable content. It was mainly a marketing ploy, but it worked. [..] Publishers were encouraged to create high-quality titles in other ways as well. Each publisher was only allowed five releases per year, so effort was put into making those few titles successful. newlinechar  newlinechar Aside from being more general in its description, the Official Nintendo Seal does not vouch for quality like the old Official Nintendo Seal of Quality did.'
Since my tax dollars do not support the policies pursued by Turkey and since there is no blowback on America from the policies pursued by Turkey I think we can all see that your statement is not only plainly false, but terribly hateful.
Incredible! It's still gone entirely over your head. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Go eat a book on statistics. It might help you understand how wrong you are. newlinechar  newlinechar I've almost certainly forgotten more statistics than you'll ever know.  Give up on the (yes, it is an) ad hominem angle, you're only making a fool of yourself. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If they were saying that only 10% of internet domains have MX records and didn't examine any then they aren't representing the Internet. If they were saying that 10% of their tested addresses had MX records and they ignore the other 90% then they're not representing popularity. newlinechar  newlinechar They're representing popularity among real organizations – which, [as you mentioned earlier yourself](http://programming.reddit.com/info/61tba/comments/c02klcf), is a far more meaningful measure than a random sample of IP addresses. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; FWIW, MX records aren't even a requirement for receiving mail. newlinechar  newlinechar Strictly speaking, no they aren't, but real organizations almost always use them anyway. I defy you to find *any* organization with a sysadmin experienced enough to install and patch qmail, yet whose DNS domain lacks an MX RR. Unless such configurations are prevalent, your insinuation that qmail has been thereby underrepresented by this methodology is entirely without merit. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Everyone- even Verisign sets up MX records for their parked domains. Ergo, you are wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar Fortunately, these particular surveys explicitly *do not sample the mail servers of parked domains*, which is more than can be said of DJB's ancient sample. (I would also point out that this is contradictory to your argument just two paragraphs ago, but it seems that logic isn't your forte so I'll let it slide...) newlinechar  newlinechar You're still befuddled by the most fundamental statistical principles with relation to this discussion, and you still haven't addressed the fact that DJB's 'survey' has not been replicated – and itself is so old as to be completely meaningless. Let me rehash my point for you slowly, since it still hasn't gone through your skull: newlinechar  newlinechar * DJB's original study is outdated and unverified. There is no data to support any claim of qmail being the #2 most popular mail server today, in any possible sense. *Therefore, calling qmail 'the #2 MTA on the Internet' is factually incorrect.* newlinechar * Studies of *businesses and large organizations* have shown qmail to be ranked much lower than #2 in the list of the most popular MTAs *among real installations*, despite its well-publicized use at a handful of sites. This does not entirely refute claims of qmail ranking at #2 in popularity by whatever alternate metric DJB fanboys think might put it in the best light, but these studies would sure as heck put such claims under heavy suspicion *even if those claims had any supporting evidence to begin with*. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, do you or do you not have the data or rational arguments to refute either of these plainly stated and helpfully emphasized points? So far you've got nothing, and I'm inclined to conclude that you are in fact completely full of hot air. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I think that public education needs to be better. newlinechar  newlinechar I do agree; however, that is completely irrelevant to this topic. Are you entirely there?

Good question. If you're just hashing passwords, SHA-1 should still serve even though it has been somewhat weakened.

wow guess you must have missed the article about the war on drugs.  We waste an incredible amount of money on the war on drugs and we have doubled incarceration of Americans since 1980.  Also have you thought about the fact that if marijuana were legal there would no longer be any justification for not allowing industrial hemp to be grown in the United States?(very few states have this in place).  We have decimated the worlds biodiverse forests when all along we could be using hemp.  I'm not saying there aren't more important issues, although alien invasion is low on my priority list
Stories like this make it clear that the problem is far worse than Americans not caring about the political process and the decisions that get made in their name. newlinechar  newlinechar Why does this collective hate exist? How can a society become this badly broken that it's people reject the built-in human notions of empathy and compassion? newlinechar  newlinechar Were I an American, I would be far more afraid of my fellow citizens than any 'terrorists' the administration and media hoots on about.

&gt; Because the decision on who gets citizenship and who doesn't is based on an arbitrary binary division, in this case religion rather than race. newlinechar  newlinechar In principle, you are right. However, the fact is that Israel is not open to non-jewish immigration. It is impossible to do so without losing the jewish national character of Israel, which is by definition a jewish state. The only way you could allow 'palestinians' on occupied territories to become citizens is annexation, which isn't something anyone would want; and even if that happened, who guarantees that once the borders are removed and the communications are open again, they wouldn't go back to suicide bombings when they don't like, for example, taxes or national holidays? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It is a plain fact that Israel is the de facto power in Israel and in the Occupied Territories, but voting rights are not extended to the people living in the Occupied Terrritories - unless they are Jewish. newlinechar  newlinechar **Citizens** newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The plain fact is that if I emigrated to the West Bank, the question of whether or not I would be granted a vote would be based on my religion. That is Apartheid plain and simple. newlinechar  newlinechar You can emigrate to Israel if you are jewish. This would entitle you to a citizenship. I doubt that anyone who emigrates to the territories and not Israel can get citizenship, not sure though.

I laughed at bottled water consumers until our local drought made everyone try to account for the amount of water they drink, use, and waste each day. Drinking from a bottle helps know how much you're drinking. It's less wasteful than a water fountain. It's cheap enough and popular enough that i can go into Target and buy my FEMA recommended 10-cases of bottled water and not have to special order it. newlinechar  newlinechar True, in many situations it's economically careless to buy bottled water. I should carry my water bottle with me from home filled with tap water. But if I'm in a convenience store and looking for something to drink, I shouldn't feel guilty about buying bottled water over some other drink. Water doesn't have the enamel eating phosphoric acid of carbonated drinks, nor the addictive calorie-laden high fructose corn syrup of sugared sodas, nor the possibly carcinogenic artificial sweeteners of diet drinks. newlinechar  newlinechar Bottled water encourages people to first break their addiction to the mass marketed sodas. Don't laugh at people for taking this step, encourage them to learn about the economic savings of using your own bottle later.

C++ is a waste of time. There's too much noise; there're too many exceptions.

Let us not confuse the scope of Clinton's Balkans actions with the simultaneous occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. I remember that the invasion of Somalia happened under Bush Sr.'s 'New World Order' as if Gulf War I wasn't enough military action to squeeze into one presidential term. I also remember that both parties were swept up in the regrettable aggression of the cold war, but the cold war was another era, and we are living in the present. In the present, we are getting ourselves swept up in a replacement for the cold war that will prove even more regrettable. Unlike most* Republican candidates, Democratic candidates are admitting our mistakes in Iraq and arguing about the fastest way to reasonably withdraw, while most* Republican candidates talk openly about the possibility of including Iran in the brawl. We are spilling our precious blood and treasure in the ungrateful sands of the middle east, and we will have only a battered economy and international disdain to show for it.

I was about to post a new thread but then I saw yours.... newlinechar  newlinechar You see, changing ones mind on a subject, IMO, is actually quite a good thing. At the very least it is not necessarily a bad thing. It can show that someone's opinions have changed over time; That their beliefs have matured.

It shows that the person is not just a pandering to those who talk about 'convictions'.

&gt; Yes but you fail to touch on the crux of the matter. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, I was just addressing the fear part, not the origins causes of homophobia. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Why should having sex with another man be so terrifying? newlinechar  newlinechar I think the fear is mainly nurtured. Here's the main the reason, I think: gays are less likely to reproduce. It's not really a natural fear for the child, but one that is encouraged in children by the family: parents, and as often grand parents and siblings who learned it from the above. It starts very young and is not explicit and not concious for many, it's done simply by enforcing gender role which teaches what both sex are supposed to be, which eventually includes sexuality. Ultimately harmful, I think, but a kind of *protective instinct* (at least in part cultural) nonetheless. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Men who fear penetration accordingly often treat women as lesser beings - because they are penetrated. newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry, I'm not touching that one with a ten foot pole (no pun intended...) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I do think this situation has something to do with a primal fear of being dominated and subdued through a particular interpretation of penetrative sex. newlinechar  newlinechar The great phallus, as feared as it is venerated!

It's not entirely their fault.  Part of the reason is the Bayh-Dole Act, which made it possible for universities to patent research that resulted from federal funding.  This act in effect remade universities into profit-seeking companies. newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh-Dole_Act newlinechar  newlinechar Another reason is that many of them never had  proper training on how to teach classes.  Most of them maybe had a TAship for a few semesters during graduate school.

&gt; The information that I have read seems to indicate that it would be stupid to try to build an app for which multiple cores would be useful, like, say, Photoshop, in Python. newlinechar  newlinechar Building something like Photoshop in *pure* CPython would be rather stupid, indeed.  But not because of the GIL; rather because CPython can be 100-1000x slower than C for raw pixel crunching.  That's way too much to compensate with hardware. newlinechar  newlinechar But as soon as you can delegate performance-critical portions of the processing to a suitable subsystem (e.g. PIL, NumPy, a GPU, or even stuff written in Pyrex/RPython and similar tools), the GIL quickly becomes mostly irrelevant.  Ruling out CPython because you cannot imagine using a layered implementation approach is more than stupid. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And then you're programming in C newlinechar  newlinechar Or perhaps Java ;-) newlinechar  newlinechar (given the current work on [Jython 2.5 and beyond](http://www.lysator.liu.se/upplysning/20071017.html), I wouldn't be too surprised if Jython/Java turned out to be an important platform for high-performance Python in a not too distant future...)

Blizzard makes the killer apps which is what keeps people from throwing away their PCs. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, you need to upgrade for UT3 sooner than for WOW. But you still need pretty respectable hardware to run WOW:TBC on full settings and I know many people who have upgraded their PCs specifically for WOW expansions. newlinechar  newlinechar WOW gets people hooked and gets people to not throw away their PCs. WOW creates communities of PC gamers... and then as individuals move to other games, their WOW friends hear about it and move too. WOW is IMO the best word to mouth marketing environments there is. newlinechar  newlinechar Team Fortress 2 is an excellent example. I have a friend who was in a wow guild, and he came and played TF2. He told his guild, and all of these people who had raerly played any other PC game (wow was either their first PC game or the only one they still played) went and bought TF2. Not all of them stayed - but that is the nature of every new release. Most went back to WOW. Some upgraded entirely to see TF2. newlinechar  newlinechar But Valve sold a ton of copies thanks to WOW word of mouth advertising.

That's just the wonder of the internet. It makes people feel safer and more secure about speaking out because they aren't face to face with people (and they don't have to leave their chairs to do it).

Seriously.  The only reason the new company will be called Activision Blizzard is because not too many non-gamers even know who Vivendi is. newlinechar  newlinechar If people even bothered to read the article, Vivendi will be the majority share holder in this merger.

We do not anticipate any difference in Blizzard's operations as a result of the combination. Joining forces with Activision will create a stronger and more diversified company that we anticipate will benefit and strengthen both brands. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: What will happen to the Blizzard brand name? newlinechar A: The Blizzard brand name will stay the same as it's always been: Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: What will change with regard to the day-to-day operations at Blizzard? newlinechar A: There will be no changes in the way Blizzard operates. All of the people, processes, and philosophies that have made Blizzard so successful will be preserved. Blizzard will benefit from all-star sales and distribution teams to service our products. In addition, the combined company will be stronger financially, managerially, and operationally. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: How will this impact Blizzard's games? newlinechar A: This will not impact Blizzard's games. We remain committed to providing the same high-quality game content and support that we always have. Development on Wrath of the Lich King and StarCraft II, as well as on our unannounced games, is continuing as normal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will there be any visible differences in Blizzard's logo or packaging/marketing materials as a result of this deal? newlinechar A: No, there won't be any changes to our company name, logo, packaging/marketing materials, or anything else along those lines. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will there be any management changes at Blizzard as a result of this deal? newlinechar A: No, there won't be any management changes at Blizzard as a result of the combination. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will Activision and Blizzard now share development teams? newlinechar A: No, both of our companies will continue to operate as they have previously with regard to game development. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will the release schedules for any Blizzard games be impacted? newlinechar A: No, the transaction will not have any impact on our games, our day-to-day operations, or our release timelines. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will any of Blizzard's offices close as a result of the deal? Or, will any new offices open? newlinechar A: No, all of our offices will continue to function as they have, and we don't foresee the need to open any new offices for the time being. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will any employees move to different offices as a result of the deal? newlinechar A: We don't anticipate making any such moves as a result of the deal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Does this deal include Activision's and Blizzard's international offices? newlinechar A: Yes, every part of our companies in the U.S. and abroad is involved in this deal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: If Activision Blizzard is a public company, does that mean I'll now be able to buy stock in Blizzard? newlinechar A: Activision will be renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc and will continue to be a publicly listed company traded on NASDAQ. You will be able to buy stock in the combined company. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: When will the transaction be complete? newlinechar A: The transaction is subject to approval of Activision shareholders, customary closing conditions, and regulatory approvals. Pending approval, the companies expect the transaction to be completed by mid 2008.

The acceptance of racism spawns more racism + ignorance and leads to all the problems that we had in the past. I think it's pathetic that one side has invested so much into righting their wrong-doings (yeah whites fucked up big time but they're trying hard to amend it. *real* hard.) whilst another group in this case blacks helps to propagate the problems of history and negate their efforts whilst continually criticizing whites for being the forebears of such problems.

It depends on your engine. In some engines you have to have the fields listed in your SQL in order before it will use the combined index.  Also the combined index may be ignored if you only ask for one or two of the fields. newlinechar  newlinechar Very few applications always ask for the same fields in the same order all the time. newlinechar  newlinechar You have to take it on a case by case basis. newlinechar  newlinechar A good database can give you a report of the top 10 longest running queries every day so you can optimize them. newlinechar  newlinechar Overall I agree with urusai. The engine should be smart enough to figure it out and adapt as usage patterns change over time.
Yes, I want huge orbital platforms beaming down gigawatts of energy towards the surface. That sounds like a great idea.
Yeah, cause everybody in the know knows that the real agents don't go to some school that everybody knows a lot about like Yale.  The real agents all went to Brown.

Other than that... unless you went there, I bet you don't know anything.   newlinechar  newlinechar Think about it.  
What makes you so sure his 'death' isn't a deceptive ploy?
Exactly!   They have every right to exclude someone they see as a threat.   Hell, if I were linked to Big Business I would use every means necessary to eliminate exposure to a candidate that will end it.   Like, I dont know, putting in some 5% minimum poll percentage.  If he makes it, we will just cancel the debate.   Then, when its time to print what each candidate stands for, we can find something that Tancredo has done that Paul hasnt and use that.
&gt;How embarrassing is it to this country that a racist can actually be running for president and pulling in millions in campaign contributions. I have to think that many people just don’t know what Ron Paul believes and if they did, they would denounce him and ask for their money back.

Nov.30 only brought in half a million.

Commodities are a protection against the rise in price of commodities.

I used to be sorta dragged into these very conservative Christian Youth conferences and I still remember several years ago (I couldn't have been more than 12 or so) when the church service started off with a similar video on this gigantic screen when thundering speakers, except this video was 10x as graphic with worms crawling out of burning bodies and screaming and blood everywhere. newlinechar  newlinechar As an atheist, it was appalling to see not only all these literally hundreds and hundreds of preteens to young teenagers scared shitless and crying, but all the little toddlers who were screaming. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, the first two videos weren't really all that bad. The porn one was a bit iffy, but I'd welcome Christianity turning toward an attitude more like that of the first. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: it should be said though, that it's not like churches are constantly indoctrinating children with these types of videos.

&gt; I don't understand why he thinks the first thing to do with C++ is say 'let's not use these pieces.'  newlinechar  newlinechar I have been using C and C++ for over 15 years. I know a number of people I consider experts in C. However, I have only ever met one person who I think even comes close to being an expert in C++. The language and its libraries are simply way to huge for anyone to be come an expert in all of it. newlinechar  newlinechar On top of that you get three experienced C++ programmer together to work on a new project and they will have three different subsets of the language that they are comfortable with. &lt;b&gt;Thats&lt;/b&gt; when the three coders have to decide which parts of the language they decide to drop.
On the equator?
There are in fact many cases where C++ beats C in practice, unless you resort to really questionable macro techniques in your C code. For example, say you want to write a sorting function and have it inlined at a call site specialized with a particular comparison predicate. In C the predicate would usually be passed as a function pointer, which makes it very difficult to optimize (in practice, I've never seen a C compiler do it); in C++ the predicate would be anything implementing the bool operator()(const T&amp;) protocol at compile time (the predicate type becomes a template parameter), and if you pass a function object rather than function pointer, inlining  and specialization is possible (any decent compiler would do it). You could get a similar effect in C by putting your sorting function into a macro, which C die-hards have been known to do, but you really shouldn't have to engage in such evil rituals.
I'm not saying she was being a racist bitch, I'm sure she meant well. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That doesnt change the fact there are a lot of cultural misunderstandings going on.

You clearly do not understand the effect subsidies play in the oil business.....they are the only thing keeping oil cheap. If wind/solar  had these same subsidies they would be competitive. I haven't even touched on other types of subsidies like R&amp;D. Being the cheapest does not mean being the best....I bring up lead laden toys at wal-mart as an example. Keeping energy centralised is vital to retaining power. You can't get people to fight for oil and no bid contracts in the mid east if everyone has an electric car and solar panels.

As a Christian, I have to agree with you. Live and let live, as they say. Who cares if a movie is anti-religious or pro-religious?
For the most part I agree with your statement AngryProfessor, although I think you are ignoring some of the benefits of having researcher teaching classes. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar First, there aren't a whole of other people who could teach some of the specialized higher level classes.  There might only be a few hundred individuals in that nation with the knowledge and experience to teach EBME 461: Biomed Image Processing and Analysis, and I bet 90% of them are academic researchers.  A lot of generic intro classes like MATH 101: Principles of Addition and Subtraction could be taught by educators working off generic lesson plans, but the higher level courses require someone with a passion for the field. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That passion for the field and their extensive experience is another benefit of learning from researchers. Anyone can assign reading and quiz vocabulary words, but only an expert in the field can put together a curriculum that prepares someone to enter their own field.  Hell, half the readings for some of my courses was straight from journals since the work was too new to be in any textbooks, and to really test our learning one final project was an NIH grant proposal (I now sympathize with those who prepare them on a regular basis).  These courses could only be taught by practitioners in the field. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I agree that some courses could be taught by educators; people who do nothing but teach.  In my opinion that means such courses are either primary school level or bullshit.  Anyone going to a research university should intend to become a professional in their field, and the prerequisite knowledge can only be learned from other professionals actively practicing the field. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The problem isn't that professors are forced to do research at universities, the problem is that universities have been transformed from centers of learning to diploma mills.  I think the apprenticeship nature of universities with experts of the field teaching the next generation is the ideal learning environment. The problems is that universities are no longer focusing on eduction, but instead on vocation, and then doing so poorly. If all someone wants is a certificate to get a job, they should acquire it from a vocational school tuned to that field.  If all you want to do is fix broken toilets and install sinks then you don't need course work in non-newtonian hydrodynamics; you need plumbing vocation.   Likewise a computer science degree maybe overkill for designing web pages and a chemistry degree is overkill for being a mixing technician.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It looks like it gets better at the graduate level, or so I pray.  If I find any bullshit in my grad program,  I am dropping out to become professional cyclist/triathlete; fuck computer-aided drug design.

I'm not trying to troll or be insightful or state the obvious here, but every time the 'next big thing' comes in, every one jumps ship on the old 'big thing' and runs right to the new one?  First, there was CVS and it was all there was.  It was acknowledged that it wasn't perfect but we all worked around its warts and complained only a little.  Next came subversion and suddenly CVS was an ancient piece of shit that you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.  Now distributed VCS comes along and the whole idea of a centralized repository is suddenly passe. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I guarantee you that distributed VCSs are not the silver bullet they're being evangelized to be.  They have their place in the world, but I just get sick of the initial advocacy that tells me I should use it and if I don't then I must be a baby-eating monster.
Wow. That kid really thinks he's the shit.
I wonder, where are all the libertarians in this thread praising free market and how it would take care of all our problems if only we completely trusted ourselves in its warm embrace.
I agree, but not knowing myself, do you know how much energy windmills (one could buy to put on top of their house) can output on average?   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I've heard that under optimal conditions 1 square meter of sunlight is equal to about 1000 watts an hour.  With current solar panels able to convert about 15% (maybe 20%) of 1000 watts you're left with 150 watts or enough to power a few light bulbs.  So you'd need probably at least 10 square meters under optimal conditions (probably more because most of us aren't located at the equator at noon) of solar paneling to cover a normal house's energy needs.  Gas and Coal still pack quite a bit more energy. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I've just looked one up, [http://www.mikeswindmillshop.com/wgenerators.html](http://www.mikeswindmillshop.com/wgenerators.html) that generates 40 watts under 10mph winds, 800 watts at 40mph winds.  This doesn't sound like it's gonna create enough power for your average home, not that it shouldn't be used. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I also just found another page that has quite a bit of information about wind power generators, [http://builditsolar.com/Projects/Wind/wind.htm](http://builditsolar.com/Projects/Wind/wind.htm)

&gt; why doesn't the US government/bush sign it already? newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know why Bush doesn't support it, but I think its a flawed agreement. From what I know about the agreement, there isn't any teeth to it at all. It appears to be a feel-good measure to allow politicians to say they are doing something when they truly aren't. newlinechar  newlinechar I think your argument is despite this why not accept it? Well it could lead to people being complacent and not working out something better. After all why bother working on something better when you already agreed on the Kyoto Protocol? newlinechar  newlinechar As evidence that this agreement is nothing more than grandstanding, it only took a few hours for the new Australian prime minister to evaluate its effect on Australia's future. He probably looked at it and saw nothing negative, but then saw a huge political windfall and jumped at the chance. Who turns down easy politicial cachee?

The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in all directions. It was white and blinding and waterless and without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams, nightmares, death. An occasional tombstone sign pointed the way, for once the drifted track that cut its way through the thick crust of alkali had been a highway. Coaches and buckas had followed it. The world had moved on since then. The world had emptied.
exactly right. Why should we endorse a feel-good measure that accomplishes very little. If anything it seems like a cover-up to make it appear that something is being done.

[1.2 million deaths by violence since the US invasion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORB_survey_of_casualties_of_the_Iraq_War).  The lower estimates recognize that they don't measure every death in Iraq, only 'those that are reported by name in an English speaking newspaper', or 'those that show up in morgues.' Our politicians and news media use the lower estimates anyway.
Speaking of incompetence with the English language, I think you need to read your post again.

Staring a blog called 'friendly atheist' does not constitute shoving pushing your views on anyone.  newlinechar  newlinechar If your visiting a site with that name, it's a fair guess that you're interested in atheism, in which case you should expect the authors  belief system to be very clear. newlinechar  newlinechar And BTW, the problem with religious people isn't that they're smug.

The 30 second ad for Pepsi isn't supposed to make you buy it. It's supposed to make you remember it, and associate the product with a concept (youth, energy, peace, safety, wealth, etc.) Then when you go into the soda isle in the market and see sixty different sodas to choose from you choose Pepsi. That's the point of television spots for products in a saturated market.
No, a lead implementation is no good idea. newlinechar  newlinechar Common Lisp implementations are very different.

&gt;Corporation money has destroyed our government newlinechar  newlinechar Progressives like to blame the greed of corporations. Libertarians like to blame the coercion of government. Progressives want democratic action to solve corporations, and end up giving a ton of power to the government. Libertarians want the market to solve problems, and give a ton of power to corporations. newlinechar  newlinechar We need to get together and realize that elite power sucks regardless of where it originates. Progressives need to stop looking at the government as a benevolent solver of problems. Substitute *libertarians* for *progressives* and *the market* for *the government*. newlinechar  newlinechar What we need is a third way. I don't even mean a third party, but a political consensus that acknowledges we need to be ever vigilant against elite power. I think this consensus can be forged and maintained on the internet. I hope that the campaign of Ron Paul is only the start. It shows we can use the internet to raise funds, get together, and act without the help of elite power. We can't trust the media, we can't trust the government, we can't trust large corporations.  newlinechar  newlinechar Here's to making the internet a constituency, and not just a tool, in both senses of the word.

Today's reporters are fed what to say in their news reports.  When you watch old movies I got the impression reporters actually investigated things themselves.  Nowadays I get the impression that reporters are hired for their attractiveness/like-ability and are hired to spew out whatever they are supposed to read off the teleprompter.  More like acting now than reporting.  
I agree that the heads flying would be some token single cases, like we saw with Enron, the rest of the perpetrators will probably just lose their jobs or bonuses at worst. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm arguing for not introducing any more regulation.  What has gone wrong in the subprime market now has been because of fraud which was obscured by complexity.  This is illegal already though we may have to amend our interpretation of it which is what will come out of the court case following this crisis. newlinechar  newlinechar Repealing legislation always has an impact, and often a short term negative impact and I think this is a responsibility that should be managed.  For example if you repeal the ban on marijuana, you have to inform the public of the risks they take (and hopefully be honest about it)  It doesn't mean that in the long run we're worse off with the law repealed.
Users don't read webpages.  They *skim* them.
&gt; But blood transfusions were not something done before the the 19th century. And then for years it was kind of odd and not practical in most cases. Blood transfusions didn't become practical until really the early 20th century. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So, it wasn't an issue people thought about or worried about until really the late part of the 19th/early 20th century. newlinechar  newlinechar While that's true, it's a novel interpretation of 'abstain from blood' that led to the JW doctrine in the first place.  This wasn't even debated in other Christian groups because Acts 15's commandment to 'abstain from blood' has always been interpreted to apply to a very particular case in a particular set of circumstances.

'Except for the fact that tail recursion in Common Lisp is optional (mandatory in Scheme, of course).' newlinechar  newlinechar Tail recursion is an implementation detail in Scheme. You can easily implement a loop macro. Everyone hates a few language features (in the case of CL a lot, the nature of the beast), Lisp allows you to deal with such things on your own terms, usually you keep around a bunch of macros and functions you feel are useful. Personally I like tail recursion and never bother to implement a loop macro.

So, why're you trying so hard to turn this into a fight? Most of your reply could be answered with the portions of my reply that you chose to ignore: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; you can do the same to most sciences. inevitably, those arguments get reduced to 'we're not omniscient, and are still working on that part.' newlinechar  newlinechar Like I said previously, 'The problem there is that we aren't attempting to understand the nature of God, we're merely attempting to sort out the rules he supposedly imposed on us.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The problem there is that any time an athiest wants to beat up on a religion, he makes a strawman out of a church or doctrine that is related to (but not synonymous with) that religion. newlinechar  newlinechar I'll leave a response to that up to some atheist that's actually doing that. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; yeah, most church doctrines are pretty easy to knock down. they're 'inconsistent with reality' etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Then I guess that makes them wrong, doesn't it? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; i can do the same with any high school physics book. newlinechar  newlinechar I double-dog-dare you. newlinechar  newlinechar The various sciences are, by their nature, consistent with observed reality ... _because observed reality forms the entire basis for the scientific method_. They are, occasionally, inconsistent with each other, however, as our observational ability has increased, we've historically found good ways to resolve those inconsistencies. newlinechar  newlinechar I haven't seen any similar resolution of inconsistencies in any of the major holy books. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; that's interesting. are you claiming that 'all religions are provably false'? newlinechar  newlinechar Here you're really hoping to debate an argument I didn't make. A U.S. fifth-grader -- not the top of their class these days -- could tell you that I said no such thing. newlinechar  newlinechar If a person says, 'I believe that a God exists', and stops there and leaves it at that, then that constitutes a religion, and it is not provably false. There's no way for me to demonstrate that some supernatural being does not exist, any more than there is a way for the other person to demonstrate that such a being does exist. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem is when all of these extra rules start getting applied to it. Then you run in to problems like free will versus moral responsibility, which is a subject that philosophers have been working on to almost no avail for millenia now. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; it IS bigotry to say they're wrong as a group. newlinechar  newlinechar Really? According to dictionary.com, bigotry is defined as 'stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from one's own.' I haven't shown any intolerance here; quite the opposite. You're failing to make a distinction between judging an idea to be wrong, versus not tolerating that idea at all. newlinechar  newlinechar If you had your way, nobody would ever be able to follow any religion, because every religion requires that you accept it as correct and other religions as false, which would -- according to you -- be bigotry. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; because your assertion is founded on an assumption about an entire group of people that is not only unreasonable, but provably false. newlinechar  newlinechar Good! My assertion wasn't very long, so it shouldn't be hard for you to point out just where it was unreasonable. Or, at least, provably false. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; it would seem wise not to post judgements about groups of people based solely on their beliefs... newlinechar  newlinechar Here, at least, you might have something, but it would be based only on a misunderstanding. I can judge a particular idea to be wrong, without negatively judging the character of the person adhering to that idea.

You clearly do not know what an earmark is. An earmark designates where the money that has already been taxed goes. If no one put down earmarks, the money would sit in limbo and wouldn't be used.

Actually, SVN has some issues of its own. For example, the fact that you can commit to multiple branches at the same time is pretty ugly (and it will haunt you when the time comes you want to migrate to a DVCS). newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that SVN integrates the tags/branches axis into the directory hierarchy axis makes it easier to use for many who have no prior experience with SCM systems, but it has some problems (like the one stated).
The chances are not independent at all, and statistics is a treacherous and complicated subject. newlinechar  newlinechar House prices, interest rates, labour conditions, economic growth, etc, have a strong correlation among different parts of a country.

Even if the first defaults are taken by others, the chance of a landslide in defaults stays considerable.

Sixty meters underground, a river used to run through the limestone of the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Because the limestone was uneven in density and porosity, the river carved an irregular channel, widening and contracting. Eventually, over a very long period of time, the surface of the land above underwent changes resulting from diminished rainfall. As the volume of water draining through the underground river decreased, the channel it had carved became a cave. Nonetheless, a trickle of rain still flowed through cracks and crevices, enough to maintain stable pools of fresh water in the lightless depths. newlinechar  newlinechar In one such pool lived a small school of fish of the family Characidae. Characids are an adaptable group, occupying many ecological niches of the planet Earth. The characids of this geologically isolated pool had several distinctive adaptations, the most unusual being that they were eyeless. Thus we can identify them henceforth as blind cave fish. Lacking sight, the blind cave fish were well equipped to detect vibrations of any sort through the sensory cells of their lateral lines, which was how they foraged for food as well as how they located each other for mating purposes. Fortunately, water is a superb transmitter of vibrations. Greater self-awareness would not have been adaptive in the bleak conditions of their pool, but if they'd possessed it, they would have had no reason to suppose that any other characids inhabited any other pool in this or any other cave, or indeed that any other pool in any other cave was inhabitable. newlinechar  newlinechar The blind cave fish had two rigid requirements for survival--oxygen and food. The oxygen in the pool was maintained at roughly the level they required by the dependable trickle of rain which replenished the loss of water through the porous limestone bed of the pool. Also, the water was cold--a constant forty-one degrees Fahrenheit--which of course allowed maximal oxygenation. Although the fish had no 'knowledge' of it, a grave danger to their survival existed in two kinds of pollution: nitrates from their own metabolic waste products, and gradual mineralization from the influx of acid rain water seeping through the soil. Periodically, however, drenching storms would flood the land, refilling the underground river channel and flushing the pool. newlinechar  newlinechar Most of the blind cave fish would be swept away to an uncertain fate, but enough would survive to rebuild their population. Even the most catastrophic flushing would not decimate them, since their eggs, which were adhesive, were always laid in protected chinks and cracks. Had the floor of the pool been smooth, or had the flooding carried other menaces into their cave, no doubt the blind cave fish couldn't have thrived as they did. It should be noted that the thick layers of rock above, which shielded them from hot sunlight, also shielded them from ultra-violet and other forms of radiation that might have threatened their survival. newlinechar  newlinechar The blind cave fish were dependent for their nutrition on another intricate and improbable set of circumstances. Since no light whatsoever penetrated the cavern, no photosynthesizing plants or algae could flourish. Nonetheless, populations of microbes and nearly microscopic arthropods shared the pool. These were the food source upon which the blind cave fish depended, though they supplemented their diet by scavenging the corpses of their own dead. In turn the arthropods and microbes were dependent on bat droppings for 100% of their nutrients. The bats, in huge numbers, infested a large dry cavern of the same cave. The only above-water outlet from their cavern to the fresh air above passed through the grotto of the pool, the ceiling of which was too encrusted with stalactites to attract bats to nest. Thus the quantity of guano the bats dropped in flight was always enough to sustain the pool's organisms yet never enough to poison the water. newlinechar  newlinechar The blind cave fish were by far the largest and most metabolically active of these aquatic creatures. Having neither predators nor competition, they had ample reason to be happy with their lives--that is, had they had enough self-awareness to exhibit happiness--since each and every condition of their environment seemed specifically suitable to their needs, while any variation of those conditions would have made their life impossible. Indeed, the conditions in which they subsisted were so random yet so improbably assembled that it must have seemed to the fish--again granting them the self-awareness to consider probabilities--that the pool had been designed to provide for their existence. Allowing them just a bit more rationality than they truly possessed, logic would surely have suggested to the blind cave fish that where there is design, there must be a designer. newlinechar  newlinechar No matter how much intellect we attribute to our three-inch long albino eyeless characids, however, it's clear they had no means of fathoming the nature of the designer, unless it were itself an inscrutable but omnipotent blind cave fish.

&gt;I would suggest your knowledge of the geopolitical role the US has played in recent decades is wanting to say the least. newlinechar  newlinechar Glad to see I'm talking to someone who stands behind their attacks. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Would you care to provide examples of altruistic military interventions you believe the US has unilaterally partaken in. newlinechar  newlinechar The Korean Conflict was an altruistic intervention, as was Bosnia.  Of course, in cynicism, I'm sure you'll spout off all sorts of reasons they weren't.  It is also quite difficult to find an 'intervention' that the US has 'unilaterally' partaken in... Iraq 1 and 2 certainly weren't unilateral as much as people like to claim. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, it might be helpful, since you continue to stand behind your demeaning and asinine assertions that my 'knowledge of the geopolitical role the US has played in recent decades is wanting,' for you to prove that.  If not, apologizing would be the civil thing to do, but its obvious that your ideology makes you label me as bad and stupid instead of reading the words I write at face value.  Such pomposity is disgusting. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I would disagree with your suggestion that the world by and large sits back and does nothing. Furthermore I would venture that the US has taken an active role in preventing multilateral corrective actions. newlinechar  newlinechar Name some times where the 'world' has acted on behalf of those nations being oppressed and actually accomplished something.  I'd be particularly interested in the times when the US was not involved or protested these actions and something was accomplished. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, your idiotic assertion that the US is 'preventing' multilateral corrective actions, is quite telling.  Prove that.  Also, explain why the 'world' is not capable of a proactive stance on issues as opposed to being a slave to the United States' choice to act or not act on world issues. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;and increased terrorism and nuclear proliferation worldwide. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd like to see you prove that Iraq *caused* that.  You can certainly prove that there is a correlation between Iraq and 'increased terrorism,' but you are unable to prove it. newlinechar  newlinechar Just a point of advice: newlinechar  newlinechar I have taken a bit of indignant tone in this post because of your continued assertions of my 'wanting' knowledge on the subjects I am speaking about.  I would encourage you to, in the future, quit with the juvenile mindset that your opinions and knowledge are more complete than others' and that, since I disagree with you, I must be stupid or less informed than you.  There are rational opinions on many sides of different issues that can be backed up with facts, and I am certainly one that changes my opinion when facts present themselves.  I would encourage you further to do your best not to base *how* you read what I write on your preconceived notions of me.  Believe it or not, even someone you don't like can speak truth.  You have made a large amount of baseless assertions in your response, and I am looking forward to you backing them up.

Basically. newlinechar  newlinechar If you have any personal or private issues that you're ashamed about or need to hide (such as taking the occasional toke, fucking your wife in the ass on every second Tuesday, or having a mistress), then those are things that a foreign intelligence service will use to blackmail you. newlinechar  newlinechar If the ISI or Mossad comes to you and says 'We know that you and your wife are swingers, work for us or you lose your job', then the CIA wants your response to be 'So what?

I can't help but notice that the atomic work stopped around the time of the Iraq war (2003 according to the article), not when the sanctions were put in place.

Freedom of religion means the government has no say in religion.  Part of that is that they can't define what is and isn't a religion.

&gt;You have control over your own destiny. newlinechar  newlinechar True, but sometimes people don't realize that.  newlinechar  newlinechar There's this bird that showed up at my house a few days back.

The guy told me told me something that I think applies to many people who were raised in strict religions. He said that sometimes when birds  escape from their homes, or are released after being rehab'd for whatever reason--even those that are wild--they still think they're in a cage and will stay in the same general area. It can take them quite a while to figure out that they can fly away and they'll be ok.  newlinechar  newlinechar I can attest to that feeling of not knowing what to do once you're out of the 'cage'.

&gt; This is really a question of what is Congress's job and how should they best function.

The JVM was originally designed only to run Java, which is (for the most part) a type safe language.  And pretty much no matter how you specifically define type safety, an implementation of 'eval' is its antithesis. newlinechar  newlinechar Getting dynamically-typed languages like Python running on the JVM was always ungainly and inefficient until [Java 6 included a new bytecode to specifically support it](http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/dynamic_languages.html).  Likewise, to my highly uninformed and speculative knowledge, the JVM doesn't like to mix code and data; this is why getting C++ code to cooperate with Java requires JNI, while the .NET CLR, which followed a different security model and design philosophy, can run 'unsafe' code directly. newlinechar  newlinechar So how did they do it? My guess would have been a heavy kludge of abstraction over the actual Java bytecode, like JRuby's pre-JVM 6 implementation of dynamic typing.  There would presumably be a heavy performance penalty for this, but given jesusphreak's [positive report on Clojure's performance](http://programming.reddit.com/info/621h4/comments/c02l4p6), maybe that isn't the case. newlinechar  newlinechar OK, so I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about here.  But I agree with Aeiri that, at least on the surface, implementing 'eval' efficiently in JVM bytecode seems perplexing; and I'm curious as to how it's done.

***An email I received today*** newlinechar  newlinechar Eureka!!!!!  9 Ron Paul supporters participated in the Townsend Parade with a Merry Christmas banner and 2 Ron Paul Knoxville banners. newlinechar  newlinechar Guess who was 2nd in line at the parade?  None other than Congressman John Duncan.  I ran to him like a kid in a candy store to ask him why he endorsed Thompson.   newlinechar  newlinechar I made the comment that he frequently votes like Ron Paul, and the Ron Paul supporters would like to know why he endorsed Thompson when he votes more like Ron Paul.  For once in my life I made a politician speechless.  He stumbled for a moment and finally mustered that he likes both of them and he wouldn't say anything bad about either of them.  I let him know that we weren't expecting him to say anything bad, but that we wanted the reason that he choose to endorse Thompson instead of Paul.   newlinechar  newlinechar He pulled out his lucky pennies and started handing them out.  Needless to say I did not back down.  I was persistent and got the answer we all knew, but were waiting to hear straight from the horses mouth.   newlinechar  newlinechar I followed with we certainly would appreciate your endorsement.  He said something to the effect that Thompson was from TN, and that he didn't think a Congressional endorsement meant much.  If that's the case, then why do the endorsement?   newlinechar  newlinechar Then he stated something that is Golden, that I hope is true.  He said Thompson's probably going to drop out soon anyway!   Duncan would know, so this is wonderful.  No date was given for this, but I would like to believe rather than hope that it will be before Super Tuesday.  If Thompson drops out before Super Tuesday, then Ron Paul could very well win the state of TN. newlinechar  newlinechar My persistence continued and he finally gave me the reason 'you have to be good to those that have been good to you'.  So in summation, Duncan was saying there's one complicated word why he endorsed Thompson at this POLITICS.   newlinechar  newlinechar Isn't it slimy?  I give thanks to our Father who art in Heaven, that Ron Paul is different.   newlinechar  newlinechar For the record, I still believe Duncan is much better than the crap we have in Congress, but I never miss an opportunity to hold my representatives to the fire!!!!!!!! newlinechar  newlinechar To liberty!
&gt; But to open everything up to 'the mob' is a terrible idea. newlinechar  newlinechar That's what 'democracy' means.  newlinechar  newlinechar  Right now the system of 'elite rule' is taking the richest country in the world and putting it in the poorhouse through perpetual war and unrestricted government spending.

But at the same time, we can't invite the government in to help us out without making sure they won't get their foot in the door and start controlling what we want to see. newlinechar  newlinechar Net Neutrality has nothing to do with restricting access to the Web.  It just means that ISP's have to act as 'common carriers' and let everything through unrestricted, the same way that phone companies cannot restrict  who calls you or who you call. newlinechar  newlinechar If you think Democracy is bad, what do you thihk should be put in its place? newlinechar  newlinechar If you think that the problem is just that the people are ignornant, we just need to open Universities to everyone regardless of income, the way that High Schools are now. newlinechar  newlinechar That would give you an informed educated public that would be well-qualified to make decisions, at least as well as our currrent 'the internet is a bunch of tubes' Senators.

How do you go about proving what kinetic/potential energy are equal to without first knowing that f=ma?  It would make sense that f=ma would come out of equations using 1/2mv^2 and mg since they're both derived using f=ma.

It all really boils down to land.

Ron Paul is starting to get, dare I say it, positive coverage from the MSM.

My friend - if it's an 'agreement', or a 'dialogue', it IS a 'commitment'.

The theory part comes in when we start talking about above-genome level change, which has never been observed in the two-three hundred years of human scholarly observations.  Hence; theory.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is what the creationists like to gripe about; they're more than willing to admit that adaptation happens within 'Genesis Kinds' or 'Baramins', but the idea that the same process of gradual change over extended periods or infinitessimally-likely massive alteration supported by radical environmental alteration is simply something they refuse wholesale. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Whomever downmodded this is a supporter of fundamentalist Christian ignorance.

I've commented on this before, but at this hour I can't be bothered to dig through my comment history to find it.  To put it succinctly, I think police need to be elevated as a profession...pay should be roughly doubled, at least, but on the flipside, a bachelor's degree (any degree) should be a minimum requirement. newlinechar  newlinechar The vast majority of idiots that give cops a bad name could easily be weeded out by that simple requirement, but pay needs to come up to a much higher level.  It's almost the same situation as teachers - the nation suffers a shortage of teachers because a degree is required, but the pay simply does not match the investment required to get that degree in most cases.  Like the police, there are many, but not enough, who do it for altruistic reasons.  In both cases, pay and standards need to be raised so that competent individuals who are, like most people, motivated by pay at least as much as passion, will be attracted to the job while the incompetent and abusive power addicts are, mostly, washed out.

It depends on how far back you extend evolution, say all the way back to the big bang, and then at your own choosing declare a God to have set everything in motion. If you look at ID at its core there is an understanding of deep-time (i.e., it isn't creationism, though creationists cite it to suit their purposes); it just recognizes that mutation and natural selection isn't enough to produce the complexities we now see in the cell. newlinechar

I disagree with Joel's comparison of products programmers versus in-house programmers. It is possible that he is saying this so he can hire more people for his company. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In a products company people care too much about the code. This means you will not have the freedom to use Ruby on Rails there either. If your team is filled with performance nazis forget about creating beautiful abstractions or anything interesting. You will write mind-numbing code. Also let's understand that the goal of management is to make programmers completely dispensible. You will not be allowed to write clever algorithm even if they improve performance and code readability if putting that into the code will make you indispensible. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As an in-house programmer you have much more freedom to define what the code looks like from the inside. The users only care about what it does - they don't care about how you implemented it. If you just read about this weird new style of programming where you throw exceptions instead of calling methods - you can go right ahead and implement that. No one's going to care. All they care about is that the code keeps working. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And the best jobs truly are the consulting jobs that he is dismisses completely. The salaries for consultant are not $47,000. Generally consultants make more than in-house and product programmers. Also every few months you fly to a different city and work on a completely different problem. This gives consultants a lot more raw material to think clearly about design. If you are doing the same thing over and over again you can easily refactor that into a library and reuse that. This opportunity for reuse only exists in consulting. In most product programming reuse will not give you the same multiplicative edge that it will in consulting.

It read in part: newlinechar  newlinechar “ 	 newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 'During her employment at the CIA, Ms. Wilson was undercover. Her employment status with the CIA was classified information, prohibited from disclosure under Executive Order 12958. At the time of the publication of Robert Novak's column on July 14, 2003, Ms. Wilson's CIA employment status was covert. This was classified information. Ms. Wilson served in senior management positions at the CIA in which she oversaw the work for other CIA employees and she attained the level of GS-14 — Step Six under the federal pay scale.

Well, I've been raising a *Geococcyx californianus*, he'll take care of the coyote if there's any trouble.
But 'scientific' fact isn't the same as 'theory' in a scientific context, as has already been pointed out.
I'd call that C# major, but that's just me.
I'll begin with an apology for taking what, in retrospect, does appear to be a condescending tone. It doesn't further debate and certainly wasn't my intention from the outset.   newlinechar    newlinechar I'll address the point of contention concerning Iraq's post-war situation first. I'm afraid I would have to disagree in the strongest possible terms that it is 'difficult to say the invasion has made things worse'. Which is no mean feat considering the state of the country following ten years of sanctions, effectively crippling the country socially and economically. I'm not sure how it would be possible to conclude that life for the average Iraqi citizen was improved by the invasion. The human cost in the post-invasion years is perhaps the most damning aspect. I'm sure you're aware of the Hopkins studies, the latest of which in October 2006 suggesting a figure for deaths attributable to violence ranging between 426,369 and 793,663. In addition to the direct loss of life the effect on social infrastructure has be devastating. The limited social programs that were in place before the war became unsustainable. Right through to January 2007 electricity generation had fallen below pre-war levels. The majority of the country still lacks sanitation, 32% of the population have access to clean drinking water, 19% have access to a sewage system. There is a national shortage of food, 25% are totally dependent on emergency rations. I don't think it would be unreasonable to suggest a large percentage of the population will be forced to forgo a formal education. In Baghdad 75% of children no longer attend school, following the invasion over half Iraq's schools were declared in need of rebuilding, literacy levels are now lower among 15 year olds than 35 year olds.   newlinechar    newlinechar Moving on to the sociological effects on Iraqi society. Preceding the war, Iraq was one of, if not the only secular society in the region. The majority of Iraqis identified nationally and not along religious lines. The result of the infrastructural breakdown, outlined in the previous paragraph, and creation of a power vacuum has formented the sectarian conflict that has engulfed Iraq. Which leads into my claim that the invasion of Iraq has 'increased terrorism and nuclear proliferation worldwide'. I can't claim credit for this statement though as I'm essentially paraphrasing the CIA and practically every other intelligence agency, specialist/committee on international affairs in the world. The reasons for the increase are fairly straightforward. Partly for revenge, in the case of low-level terrorism, but on the issue of international terrorism and proliferation it is a question of self-defense. I fear this is getting a little long winded but I'll be happy to elaborate on that.   newlinechar    newlinechar For me the tangible costs of the 'just war' type intervention that took place in Iraq are insurmountable when offset against the potential benefits. To move on to my second point and return somewhat to my suggestion that the US has acted contrary to preventing human rights abuses, there are dozens of questionable examples but I'll begin with one close the previous topic. Saddam was eventually convicted for the crimes he committed in 1982, accurately so. Coincidently 1982 was the year Iraq was dropped from the list of states supporting terrorism. And support continued right through 87 and 88 when he was gassing the Kurds, perhaps 100,000, but the US didn't object. The administration at the time actually successfully blocked congressional efforts to even protest Iraq's use of chemical weapons against civilians let alone take action.   newlinechar    newlinechar This sort of selective recognition wasn't what I was really alluding to though. To get a true grasp of the inaction and active contempt for humanitarian concerns the US has shown in its foreign policy you have to look toward its record at the UN. The US leads every nation by far in its use of the veto, for starters it's easy to show that until recently the US has blocked every Middle East peace proposal thats been forwarded. There is comprehensive evidence of inaction on the United States behalf in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Declassified State Department documents show that the US applied diplomatic pressure at the UN to discourage intervention during the peak of the attrocities.   newlinechar    newlinechar Another example that is often described as an altruistic intervention is the deployment of troops to Somalia during the famine in 1992. What isn't mentioned is that the US was the chief supporter of the Somali Warlord Said Barre from 1978 through to 1990, While he destroyed the country and slaughtered around fifty thousand people. When the proxy regime collapsed in 91' the US simply pulled out and the country descended into civil war. The US still refrained from acting as the famine and fighting reached its peak in the first half of 1992. However elections rolled around in November and suddenly troops were deployed, unfortunately the famine was almost over by this time and the troops probably did more harm than good. Its actually possibly the troop deployment re-escalated the violence, US government reports suggesting 6,000 to 10,000 casualties. The point is there was a much better alternative. The bombing of Kosovo in 1999 is another example of intervening to exacerbate the problem. Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Haiti, East Timor a plethora of SE Asian countries. There really are a wealth of cases.    newlinechar    newlinechar Let me know if you require sources for anything I've claimed above.

Having recently been laid off by the company that started the Sub-Prime trend, I have to say -- that's a **bit** unfair. It's not the sub-prime industry that's exploitative; at least, not inherently. Where that comes in is in the mortgage brokers who work pure commission and have no responsibility to the customer.  newlinechar  newlinechar I've seen some heinous shit that, as the bank, we had no authority to stop. We couldn't even tell the home-buyer not to make the deal; we weren't allowed to do so. (In most cases, by the time we dealt with the buyer, the signing had already occurred and they were basically fucked no matter what.) newlinechar  newlinechar But *sub-prime* itself, were it used responsibly, would be beneficial. The problem is that everybody relied on other people to be responsible.  newlinechar  newlinechar Combine that with the massive rats' nest of regulations and procedures for the mortgaging and real estate purchasing, and it's just too much for the non-expert to make informed decisions. This relegates, thanks to government interference, the traditional free-market expression of *caveat emptor* obsolete in this area. newlinechar  newlinechar We ***could*** make things sufficiently simple so that a home-buyer could figure out like one would when shopping at the grocery store which items are the better deal. But, frankly, the modern median-average consumer basically just bends over and holds his ass-cheeks open. Here's an example; when's the last time you asked for a deal or benefits at a clothing retail store? When's the last time you did price comparison at the corner convenience store? Could you see this happening frequently? newlinechar  newlinechar ***That*** is what *caveat emptor* was all about. But the way things are today, the effort involved is Sisyphean.

Indeed, in hindsight, it never should have happened.  The point is that every executive officer has a heavy responsibility to identify serious, violent offenders who have become such a low risk that it no longer serves the purposes of justice or public safety to spend tens of thousands of dollars annually incarcerating them.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Like governors throughout the country, Huckabee had that responsibility and he exercised it.  I don't think he exercised it unreasonably in this particular circumstance -- the man paroled appeared to the objective observer to have reformed himself dramatically, and he had already suffered an extra-judicial castration, which made it a reasonable inference that he would be very unlikely to reoffend.  Of course, we know that he did reoffend.  But I think we need to judge parole and pardon decisions on the basis of the information then available, recognizing that there is, sadly, no such thing as a sure thing.  We simply cannot afford to lock up every felon for life.  We'd prevent a lot of horrible crimes that way, but we'd also lock up a lot of people pointlessly, and at unbearable public expense. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If we crucify every governor who makes a parole or pardon decision that turns out badly in hindsight, we're going to discourage any exercise of discretion in this field.  The result won't be that the criminal justice system just keeps everybody locked up forever; rather, the result will be that the system will be administered by unaccountable, faceless board members with no aspirations to electoral office.  If that's what you want, alright, but it's short sighted and it's not going to protect anybody.  We're not choosing between a protective and a non-protective system; we're choosing between a public and a non-public system.  To keep the public system, we need to be mature about the chances we're asking these folks to take. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar An interesting and more difficult question is whether Huckabee's Christianity made him particularly gullible when presented with a professed reformed Christian convict.  I haven't seen much indication of that, though.  It looks more like the guy took a reasonable chance on somebody and got a tragic result.

Yeah, in the 16th century every winter was a desperate struggle to survive and if you gave your kid a present, which was probably a carving or a little knife or something, your family was doomed because then I guess you couldn't afford to buy groceries? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, anyone who has the luxury and leisure to post on Reddit can hardly accuse poor 16th century children from wanting a present at Christmas.

For instance, you probably believe that I work for the CIA. newlinechar  newlinechar You don't address the argument with the Agent Provocateurs comment you simply say that we shouldn't trust people who disagree. newlinechar  newlinechar From Wikipedia: newlinechar 'An ad hominem argument, also known as argumentum ad hominem (Latin: 'argument to the man', 'argument against the man') consists of replying to an argument or factual claim by attacking or appealing to a characteristic or belief of the person making the argument or claim, rather than by addressing the substance of the argument or producing evidence against the claim. The process of proving or disproving the claim is thereby subverted, and the argumentum ad hominem works to change the subject.'

&gt; Runtime-driven optimizations only get you so far, and come with a hefty price: startup and 'warmup' time. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, but why is it necessary? I never quite understood why all the work of a JIT compiler is thrown away after a script has terminated. The perfomance critical parts usually run with the same types over and over again and specializations can be reused much in the same way than C++ template specializations. What am I'm missing?  newlinechar  newlinechar BTW I would rather go a step further and drop the JIT completely and work on recorded runtime types only which are used to annotate the AST of the executed program. As a result one gets specialized functions that can be compiled natively and the original script that serves as glue code and a means to fall back to bytecode interpretation in cases where type guarded dispatch can't be applied.  newlinechar  newlinechar There will be still function call overhead but it won't slow down program execution one or even two orders of magnitude. As a byproduct type annotated ASTs can be 'unparsed' into code which is explicitely typed: people get finally their refactoring browsers.

I am not a believer in ID, as I commented [here](http://science.reddit.com/info/61t6i/comments/c02kc40), but what bothers me is many of the Scientific Dogmas (essentially declared so by the media much to the chagrin of real scientists) are protected with the virulence of a religious dogma.  When the establishment thinks one way, any dissenters are silenced, just as it always has been newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Science isn't a belief system. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course it is.  It is faith in the Scientific Method as a methodology to knowledge. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Scientists do not have the same investment in their beliefs that ID'ers have. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, that is not true at all.  For example, let's take global warming researchers.  Those researching climate change that are getting funding from the government or private enterprise *have to find evidence of climate change to keep their funding!*  If they are researching it and find nothing, why are they getting paid?  The same with any disease researchers.  If I am a scientist and am researching a new xray device, for example, and it doesn't work, I won't get any more funding for that research! newlinechar  newlinechar As far as Darwinism, there are entire fields that have sprung up around the idea: Evolutionary Biology, Evolutionary Psychology, etc.  If Darwinism was proven to be false or major holes were found in it, a lot of researchers and the foundations of their research would disappear... a life's work for many. newlinechar  newlinechar No one wants to give up their life's work or the beliefs they have, religious or secular.

Well I believe if elected (which would be a huge step for America) they would do the most any president/vp combo has ever done for civil liberties and individual rights in this country's histories going all the way back to when this country was founded.

Of course I am not saying the fossil record is just made up.  No one would make that claim.  I AM saying that the fossil record doesn't exist as portrayed in modern textbooks that are taught as gospel truth and science.  Also, there are many problems with the fossil record such as petrified trees standing straight up through layers that are supposed to be different by millions of years.  These exist all over the world and are called Polystrate Trees.  Did that tree stand there for millions of years while the layers and fossils formed around it or is it evidence of a global flood?  There is also the whole problem of the fact that the fossils are dated by the rock layers they are found in and the layers are dated by the fossils that are found in them. If you study the literature with this in mind, this will jump out at you in several texts.  It is pure circular reasoning.  You might also keep in mind that if you believe what the Bible says, the earth was probably very different before the flood and what we call the Cambrian explosion where so many fossils appear all at once could just be explained by creation.  There are so many problems with the currently accepted theories that it is just a joke when you start really digging.  Would suggest you read the book 'Icons of Evolution' by Jonathan Wells.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think the Bible pretty well explains things with this verse.   newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203:3-4;&amp;version=9; newlinechar  newlinechar First of all to validate Darwin's theory, you MUST have a very old earth. Evolution doesn't work any other way.  If there is a smidgen of proof the earth is young, it all goes out the window because for Evolution you have to have time and craploads of it.  I would suggest it doesn't even work with craploads of time but that is another discussion.  If you look back you will see that these ideas of an ancient earth came from just a few scientists.  If you believe that there is no God then you can do pretty much anything you want ?right?  Furthermore, there are many highly degreed scientists that do not believe in a old earth.  If you actually look, you will find that most of what is currently taught is based on made up or misconstrued evidence.  Would suggest you watch the video.  It presents a side of the argument I don't think you have seen. newlinechar  newlinechar

If this is how you meant it, I would say it doesn't say to me that 'choose-between' Catholics place more significance on Christmas than Easter.

My thoughts exactly. This is HUGE! If we can make CRA's pay for their gross neglegence then maybe they will clean up their act and do more to make sure that they only report 100% accurate information like they are required to by law.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm surprised that there hasn't been more cases like this. Most sources will tell you that there are millions of credit reports that contain inaccurate information. Whether it's a wrong name, wrong balance, wrong account, or flat out identity theft, etc. The law also says that credit reports have to be 200% accurate (in so many words.) So why are they allowed to get away with having so many false reports? And every time you have some false information on your credit report, it can cost you dearly.  newlinechar  newlinechar It can mean you pay higher interest rates, or you can't go on that vacation, or buy that car, or get that house, etc. The list is endless. Yet they are allowed to get away with it and you have to jump through dozens of hoops just to attempt to correct anything. And even then, you are still at their mercy.  newlinechar  newlinechar &lt;sacrasm&gt; What a great system! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

The Day God Was Born:  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Long ago, primitive people lived in caves. They had few rules and no religion. The operative social principle was 'might makes right.' The biggest and strongest men got first crack at the women and the food, and they slept closest to the fire. The small and weak got food scraps and slept in the cold dank areas of the cave. The biggest and strongest men feared only one thing, the thing that everyone in the cave feared: thunder. When thunder occurred, EVERYONE rushed to the back of the cave, even the big and the strong.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar After thousands of generations, a small man was born who was slightly smarter (due to mutation) than his cave mates. He had the ability to notice correlations between events better than other cave people. He began to notice that every time thunder happened, certain other things happened shortly before. For example, the wind began to blow harder, the temperature outside grew colder, the sky grew dark, and the birds stopped flying around.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar One day, when he noticed these signs beginning, he stood up in the front of the cave and announced, 'From now on, I get first crack at the women, the food, and the fire!' All of the big, strong men laughed at him. Then, the small man said, 'If you do not give me what I demand, my friend Thunder will come here and chase you all to the back of the cave!' Again the big men laughed. Then, the thunder came and everyone ran in terror to the back of the cave. From then on, the small man who could talk to Thunder got whatever he wanted. And that was the day God was born.

&gt; Take a recent Bush quote (paraphrased): 'Congress is acting like a kid with a credit card.' Seriously? What? Projection much? Hypocrite much? But there is a general sense that at least (we think) Bush knows he's a hypocrite, and is simply manipulating.  newlinechar  newlinechar Search for the term 'slogan' in here: [Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare](http://www.tscm.com/CIA_PsyOps_Handbook.html) newlinechar  newlinechar It's not an accident. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It's additionally frustrating and maddening because he refuses to outwardly acknowledge this duality.

It's not though, it's quite sensible, once you're familiar with the parts from which it is composed. newlinechar  newlinechar If `f` and `g` are any functions, then `f *** g` is the function which simply applies `f` to the left part of a pair, and `g` to the right part. That is, newlinechar  newlinechar     (f *** g) (x,y) = (f x, g y) newlinechar  newlinechar (which of course is already mentioned in the article) newlinechar  newlinechar So, here, the function `f` is `(*)` and the function `g` is `zipWith (+)`. newlinechar  newlinechar In the usual curried fashion in Haskell, the operator `(*)` is a function which takes a number as a parameter, and produces the function which multiplies by that number. newlinechar  newlinechar Similarly, `zipWith (+)` is a function which takes a list as a parameter, and produces the function which takes another list and adds the two lists elementwise. newlinechar  newlinechar So `((*) *** zipWith (+))` is the function which takes a pair consisting of a number m and a list xs, and produces a pair consisting of a function which multiplies its parameter by m, and a function which adds xs elementwise to its parameter. That is, newlinechar  newlinechar     ((*) *** zipWith (+)) (m,xs) newlinechar     = ((*) m, zipWith (+) xs) newlinechar  newlinechar Then, the function `(*) *** zipWith (+)` is composed with the function `uncurry (***)`.  newlinechar  newlinechar The `uncurry` function just takes a curried function of two parameters, and turns it into a function of a single parameter which is a pair. That is, newlinechar  newlinechar     uncurry (***) (f,g) newlinechar      = f *** g newlinechar  newlinechar So this just means to take those two functions in the pair that we got, and put them together with `(***)`, so that one acts on the first part of a pair, and the other acts on the second part. newlinechar  newlinechar     uncurry (***) . ((*) *** zipWith (+)) $ (m,xs) newlinechar     = uncurry (***) ((*) m, zipWith (+) xs) newlinechar     = (*) m *** zipWith (+) xs newlinechar  newlinechar So, this is again a function, which takes a pair consisting of a number and a list of numbers, let's apply it and see what we get: newlinechar  newlinechar     (*) m *** zipWith (+) xs $ (n,ys) newlinechar     = (n * m, zipWith (+) xs ys) newlinechar  newlinechar Which is not at all surprising, since the article started out with what was essentially that, except as a lambda: newlinechar  newlinechar     \(m,xs) (n,ys) -&gt; (n * m, zipWith (+) xs ys) newlinechar  newlinechar The difference is that the version using `(***)` and friends works entirely at the level of functions, whereas the lambda is specified in terms of what it does to particular values. It can be strange at first to manipulate functions in this way, but it's entirely possible to get used to it. newlinechar  newlinechar I personally think the lambda is slightly more readable in this case, but in many cases, the points-free style wins hands down. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, and the `liftM2` is another matter. In this case, it takes a function of two parameters, and a pair of lists, and picks pairs of elements from those lists in all possible ways, passing those to the function to build a list of results. If you're familiar with the list comprehension syntax: newlinechar  newlinechar     liftM2 f xs ys = [f x y | x &lt;- xs, y &lt;- ys] newlinechar  newlinechar However, liftM2 is actually more general, and works with not just lists, but in any monad. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Apologies for not adding an additional blank line before one of the code blocks (which caused it to not format correctly).
Sitting by itself it does, but context is everything, and I think people will be confused about an empty regex (or C++-style comment) here: newlinechar  newlinechar     my $foo = $bar // 42; newlinechar  newlinechar Compared to a real empty regex: newlinechar  newlinechar     $bar =~ //; newlinechar  newlinechar This might be a *little* confusing: newlinechar  newlinechar     my @foo = split //, $foo; newlinechar  newlinechar The , is a giveaway; and this is the only real use of an empty regex. newlinechar  newlinechar Regardless, it's a useful language feature that will improve the quality of my life... so I'm happy :)

No, the Iranian presient has said that Israel should be wiped off the map. This is hardly different from George Bushes remarks about 'removing Saddam', 'destroying the B'ath party' or 'shock and awe'. newlinechar  newlinechar For all you know he ment the name Israel should be wiped off the map or the Israeli government should be removed from power, not that the actual phyiscal land that is Israel should be nuked. newlinechar  newlinechar If he was saying that the Israeli government should be removed from power then this is absolutely no different than George Bush saying Iraqs government should be removed. America has set the precident that this kind of thing is acceptable.
&gt; Well, it looks like your reliance on Java has done exactly what the article predicted it would. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Go learn OCaml. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Learn about the power of type inference. newlinechar  newlinechar I had to crack up when I read that. 'Lo, I bring thee, mere mortal, unenlightened java programmer, the power of Hindley-Milner type inference!' And  the enlightened one saw that he no longer had to write out his types, and he saw that it was good. Oh, bollocks, wait: he also saw that his code, possessing no more type annotations, became impossible to understand after a few months save through a tedious mental process not entirely unlike what the compiler was doing automatically for him in the first place (at a time when he knew which type he wanted *anyway*)! Only, it now took the programmer, much, much longer -- powerful indeed! In the meantime, silly, unenlightened java programmer used Eclipse's Ctrl-space and -- bam! -- the type name appeared in a fraction of a second -- and was forever preserved in the source code for the benefit of future unenlightened coders. Moral: languages don't exist in a vacuum. Tools and libraries are important also. And: 99% of the benefits of type inference are obtained through type deduction. Why complicate unnecessarily? newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with you on pattern matching -- that is certainly a lovely feature (hardly unique to O'Caml, but that's a different story). But for every nice feature in O'Caml, there's also a really annoying feature. Two records with the same field name in O'Caml cause a compilation error! How embarrassing is that? (solution: uniquely prefix your field names with the name of your record. I'm not kidding.) Also, can you please tell me which compiler options I need to switch on in order to have this lovely factorial function of yours available from a DLL? What, you can't compile DLLs? Don't even get me started on the standard library... which is *pitiful* (and poorly designed) compared to java's -- and that's not taking into account the millions of other libraries which let me do whatever your can do with O'Caml multiplied by ten.  newlinechar  newlinechar So fuck off with your facile intellectual snobbery: just because you learned a language with first-class functions doesn't make you a genius.

I would love to see it happen, don't get me wrong, the biggest issue though is getting it on tv.

I bet pbs or npr would be down to host and pressure the candidates into appearing, or perhaps even a major network such as cnn could use it to boost ratings (imagine a debate ad stating with flashing graphics 'Not in 40 years has a debate like this happened etc. etc.' ) newlinechar  newlinechar Keep working on getting all the details on the site (no coming soon stuff, it's gotta look legit). We also need to make it clear that there are large numbers of people hitting this site, and petitioning television studios to host the debate. I hate to say it, but get the site dugg (and make sure you have the server power to handle it, give reddit the link so we can digg it) Endorsements from key democrats are needed, maybe Howard Dean. newlinechar  newlinechar If you can get a reporter to give a brief outline of the debate to a candidate face-to-face whether he/she would agree to appear in a debate such as this, youtube could be used to spread the idea of this debate. Find a group like 'Why Tuesday?' that has access to candidates and get them on board. newlinechar  newlinechar edit: you gotta change the first paragraph on the website, being 'sick and tired' of the debates by the media is not going to get the media or people on board.

Your answer to NetPhantom is correct.  An angry email won't do much.

Depending on the person, I would have no reason to think something that serious would be nothing but a joke. Even when sober. It is ridiculous to think that if they do happen to carry out what I had thought they were joking about, and it resulted in a death, that I should be punished for it for nothing more than letting who I thought was a friend go pick up some food or something to that effect when jokingly saying he is going to rob a house on the way out the door.  newlinechar  newlinechar Once again, the rest of the world 'gets it' but the US doesn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is one of those older laws that violates civil liberties more now than ever before.

That is just lewd.

You don't, you ignore them and pretend they'll go away. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Only ones that have directly attacked them. The July 7th London bombings were the UKs first ever Islamic attacks, meanwhile the Glasgow airport attack was Scotland's first ever terrorist attack in our entire history going back to the stone age. newlinechar  newlinechar You may be aware of incidents like the [1997 Luxor Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_1997_Luxor_massacre).  I wasn't aware that 50 Swiss tourists in 1997 were responsible for attacking Islam? newlinechar  newlinechar What about all of the incidents in the 1700s and 1800s? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;only an imbecile would believe 'they hate freedom' as a rationale. newlinechar  newlinechar Hey, well, it seems quite irrational to blanket dismiss something you disagree with, but you are quite talented at it.  Again, do you listen to what they say?  They (radical Muslims) hate the West and others because we meddle, but *also* because of what our values are.  Values are important, and the Western Liberal value system is the antithesis of a closed theocracy that these radicals want.  Ignoring 100,000,000 people that are actively attacking infidels is ignorant and dangerous.  You still are not taking them seriously. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;These 'leaders' have killed millions over the decades. If you grew up knowing that your father was killed in a US-led coup, would you not be angry? newlinechar  newlinechar They have every right to be angry, but that doesn't explain everything.  It is part of the puzzle, its not so black and white as to say its the 'meddling West's' fault. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Have you ever even read about the crusades? The sacking of Constantinople? I've never read anything as brutal as that from Islamic history newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sorry to hear that.  I've read a lot about the Crusades, and I am surprised you would cite them without knowing of the massacres on both sides.  In fact, I am surprised you are unaware of many massacres and wars *started* by the Islamic Caliphs and Muhammad himself, such as: newlinechar  newlinechar [The Banu Qurayza Massacre of 627](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Qurayza) newlinechar  newlinechar [The Granada Massacre of 1066](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_Granada_massacre) newlinechar  newlinechar You may also want to check out [Muslim History](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_history).  Wikipedia also provides a good overview of the wars and expansion by Islam (it wasn't for centuries that Christianity did anything like that after it had been corrupted by leaders of nations, Islam has always been violently expansionist). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Really? Or Islamic expansion through conversion. Big difference, though I admit I may be wrong in this respect, it's far from my specialist subject. newlinechar  newlinechar It was almost all conquest.  Most individuals were told to convert, become Dhimmi, or die, and that has been fairly constant throughout history. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Your use of 'infidels' as a derogatory term kind-of gives it away. newlinechar  newlinechar Gives what away?  Infidels are merely individuals who don't believe in the Prophet, etc.  It wasn't derogatory, it was accurate, and it wasn't meant in a derogatory manner. newlinechar  newlinechar I appreciate the discussion, and you bring up many good points, but I think some simple research on Islam might help your point of view and its accuracy. newlinechar  newlinechar Christianity has done some horrible, horrible things.  But Islam and what it means, many of the historical events and actions brought about under Islam, as well as many of its central tenets, make it very clear that 'hating us for our freedom' is not as foreign or absurd as you may think. newlinechar  newlinechar Its more nuanced than you make it out to be.  I acknowledge it isn't *all* because they hate our freedom, but its certainly not *only* because we meddle... that would be purely reactionary on their part and the evidence just doesn't support that assertion. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks.
you're kidding, right?
Hillary and Edwards. I drive over to Iowa to see them. newlinechar  newlinechar Hillary had really cute campaign helpers, but she wouldn't talk for more than a second. newlinechar  newlinechar Edwards gave probably the best speech / forum. Got a picture with him.

But he has commented on 9/11 conspiracies, and [dismissed them as non scientific](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4948621206141114750&amp;q=chomsky+9%2F11&amp;total=135&amp;start=0&amp;num=10&amp;so=0&amp;type=search&amp;plindex=5). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;they also need a justification for their crimes newlinechar  newlinechar And it is readily available, they don't even have to fabricate evidence, they'll just search for the report that contains what they want, even if it is over a decade old. newlinechar  newlinechar That's it, that is as far as they will go. newlinechar If they could have planted WMD in Iraq to justify the invasion - wouldn't they have done that? You might argue that at that point they had already gotten what they wanted (Iraq), but wouldn't *Lex Luther* have tried to maintain credibility (for Iran)? For the mastermind of 9/11, that would have been nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar They still oppose Marxism, and it can still justify action (just as it did in the 60s and 70s).

A stronger dollar would be better for me, as well, because I like things like BMWs and trips to Europe. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, if the dollar was *stronger * than the Euro, even I would begin to get worried.  newlinechar  newlinechar What is your reason for wanting a stronger dollar?
&gt; That is, Congress may enact and repeal legislation, not the president. newlinechar  newlinechar What I said has absolutely nothing to do with enacting or repealing legislation.  As for enforcement, I suspect Congress would have a very difficult row to hoe on that one.  I am not a lawyer, and I haven't read the full federal legal code, but my understanding is that having a drop-off point in each state's capital with strict instructions for the general citizenry to voluntarily surrender assets to those offices, enforcement falling to local police, would be sufficient to suit the letter of the law. newlinechar  newlinechar Ironically, that would probably in fact be more efficient than the current system (in my humble estimation), though the gross proceeds would of course drop off precipitously and send Congress into a panic.

Yes, Clinton is beholden to corporate interest, but nowhere near as much as George Bush. Jesus Christ, anyone who will ratify Kyoto cannot be as beholden as he is. I didn't say she was good, I said she wasn't as bad as he is. newlinechar  newlinechar Similarly, she has said she will keep troops in Iraq til 2013, but Bush plans to keep them indefinitely. Anyway, Obama has said the same thing. I'm not completely convinced this is a bad thing -- how else are we going to keep Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Iran out? Do you have a suggestion? We have discussed Iraq countless times in my government classes and nearly every scenario ends with some form of longterm American presence there. newlinechar  newlinechar As for Iran, I would be surprised if Clinton doesn't change her position somewhat given what's come to light. That's another *significant difference* between her and Bush -- she doesn't blindly hold to wrong ideas in the name of sticking to her guns.  newlinechar  newlinechar As for Gore and Bush, plenty of people said it, most notably Nader: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Nader, who said he planned to be in the audience on Tuesday night, called the Democratic and Republican parties a 'corporate party with two heads' that does not want any competition. newlinechar  newlinechar You may remember that Nader is a significant part of why Gore lost the election.

&gt; the takedown notice was likely invalid, unless the developer in question personally had material that wasn't already licensed under the GPL [...] included with the software the MPAA was distributing. newlinechar  newlinechar No, the takedown notice is valid because the software *is* GPL'ed, and MPAA was in violation of the GPL. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; did anybody ask them for the source and get refused? newlinechar  newlinechar That's not how it works. The GPL allows redistribution if you: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; - Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, newlinechar &gt; - Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, newlinechar &gt; - Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) newlinechar  newlinechar It's not enough to co-operate when asked for the source.

Kudos for making me actually think. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The LAW is the LAW that existed before time began.

&gt;Personally, I think that it is rather difficult to have an intelligent discussion when people in threads resort to attacks on the conversation itself rather than contributing anything of value.  Maybe next time you'll concentrate on the content of my message rather than nitpicking the exact grammar of post. newlinechar  newlinechar Why would I bother trying to counter the content of your post when the truth of the matter is that I agree with you, but you never bothered to find out what I thought; instead you used sloppy reasoning to arrive at assumptions.  You may call that 'whiny pedantic bitchery,' but I call it a perfectly reasonable objection to a blatant misrepresentation on your part.   newlinechar  newlinechar That said, the fact that you turn hostile when caught in an act of sloppy reasoning, instead of admitting your error, does not speak well for your character.   The truth is that I am absolutely correct that this kind of thing goes on all the time on Reddit, and as such, I think it's absolutely reasonable to point it out.  You made a choice to take offense.
well, no, I didn't literally mean that we should stick America's phallus into Israel's gaping sandy vagina, but I think it's still a decent analogy.

Yet they feel comfortable driving a one-ton vehicle at high speeds down a highway, while on the phone, within a few feet of other vehicles that are also traveling at high speeds.   newlinechar  newlinechar I don't get it.  Checking fluids is quick and easy. Making sure your tires are properly inflated is also easy. Changing headlight bulbs is very quick (and does not require a battery disconnect).  newlinechar  newlinechar Every vehicle comes with a manual that lists basic maintenance needs, and at what mileage they are to be done. You don't even have to personally do them.  Take your car to a garage once in a while to get it examined.  Don't wait until the car dies on the side of the road. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I look at computers the same way.  If you don't regularly maintain it, clean it, perform back-ups, etc. its performance will decline, or worse, you could lose all your data.

The transcript felt fake, from both sides. Who says 'my good sir' in that situation? Who has ASCII art ready and uses it after their cat just died?

If you are building a web site and expect to take more then two million hits per day then you may want to think about using something other then ruby and rails. newlinechar  newlinechar If you like ruby and would not mind using another framework like merb or whatnot then you can probably push that up to 2.5 or 3 million hits per day. newlinechar  newlinechar I guess it depends on what your expections are for your project.  For most people though it's fine. Most web sites don't really get that busy. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Until you throw in memcache. newlinechar  newlinechar you have to have memcache of course.

With over 60,000 tickets handled in our RT system over the past five years, I'd say it's extremely well suited to high volume incident support where incidents are raised by end-users, have to be tracked over time, have to be billed by time spent, and have to be prioritized or workflowed within anything from a two man shop to a multilevel organization with hundreds or more reps interacting with users.  It also works well as a project or customer request tracking tool.  It is *not* ideally suited to bug-tracking by default, but would be easily customized for that.  Note that we don't offer end users a web login, they use email.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think 'issue tracking' is a general case, and 'bug tracking' is very domain specific.  We use RT for issue tracking, and TRAC for code and bugs. We certainly wouldn't replace either one with the other. newlinechar  newlinechar

No, trademark law won't help, it was my copyrighted writing and photography that was infringed. I suppose it could be argued that my site's 'look and feel' was its trademark, they copied the whole site including the look and feel, but this is a rather vague issue to pursue when the copyright infringement was so clear. Copyright is the appropriate venue. I could hire a lawyer and go through Federal courts at extreme expense to stop the infringement, or I can use the DMCA to stop the infringement immediately, which costs me nothing but the time it takes to fill out a form letter. I could recoup any financial damages in a court action, but I don't care about that, I just wanted them to stop.
Wow, this just blew my *mind*.

The main issue I have with FogBugz, and most other issue tracking systems, is its inability to handle nested cases. I like to hierarchically organise my tasks into major tasks, their subtasks, and even smaller sub-sub-tasks.
Hm. I guess they finally introduced cross-faction mounts.
A steam-based version control system looks a lot like a sophisticated branch and merge system. The key difference is that streams have definite hierarchies. Normally each stream only interacts with its parent and child streams.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Lets say you and I are working on unrelated features. We would each have a stream dedicated to our feature. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar When I am happy with my changes, they get pushed to a shared development stream. Once there, you can pull them into your stream. It would be rare for me to send you a patch directly. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The development stream would generally have a QA stream as a parent, which in turn would have a release stream. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar All movement between streams are done in changesets, never individual files. These are usually strongly linked to an bug tracking system. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Since changes are constantly flowing along well established paths, merging is much, much easier. Creating streams on a per feature basis is very common, especially when it requires a lot of testing or won't be ready for a long time. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now I don't want to give you the impression that you can't send patches to branches other than your parent. Usually though this would only occur when you need to hot-fix something. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I can't say I know enough about Mercurial to answer on its behalf, but I would love to hear about it. newlinechar  newlinechar 
I see what you're saying, but I'm sticking with my original statement.  It is a lot *more* than just 'facts.' It's also a listing of laws, geneologies and more myths than you can shake a stick at.  A religious text that stuck to 'just the facts' would be curiously refreshing.
The ongoing discussion in Germany is, if that 'church' is breaking existing laws or not. Untill now (and I guess it wont change) there wasn't enough evidence against Scientology (just having 'anti-constitutional' tendencies is nothing illegal in Germany, promoting 'anti-constitutional' ideas/ using 'anti-constitutional' tactics can be against the law under certain circumstances). newlinechar  newlinechar And the word 'ban' might be a little bit misleading. In this case, it would mean, that Scientology could loose its right to act as registered (US based) society. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I do not see them as a big problem yet. I have seen them in our city, offering 'free tests' and I nearly felt sorry for them, since everybody just ignored them. :P
That's how I feel.  Frankly, despite some of her views on the war and censorship, I think its disingenuous to compare her to someone like Bush.

Somehow I think that it'll prove just a bit more difficult than you imagine, given the heavily-ensconced power structures that will require removal to ensure a complete return of our civil liberties.
Oh. I kindof thought that was the obvious but false answer. I mean, there were identical complaints under Bush Sr., but in both cases I think it's just a convenient political issue to use to distract voters from more important things. Because of racism, not actual economic necessity.

Many Americans are pro-life. Deal. Furthermore, the President doesn't have the power to overturn Roe v. Wade. Think about it. If he did, Dubya, Reagan, Bush Sr. or Ford would've overturn it long ago. newlinechar  newlinechar Ron Paul is not a creationist, nor does he want to dictate state school curricula. He has explicitly said he believes in evolution. He is, after all, a doctor. newlinechar  newlinechar The state governments can set up their own health care systems if their citizens freely choose to. We don't need a national government to do that for us. Many states already have some form of universal health care, including California and Massachusetts. newlinechar  newlinechar He is not in favor of any regulation of gay rights at the federal level; Washington DC is unique because it is not a state. Ron Paul is no threat to gay rights nationwide. newlinechar  newlinechar Ron Paul's personal opinion is that school prayer would be ok. As president, he would have absolutely no power to make that happen. newlinechar  newlinechar He is not for destroying Alaskan wildlife reserves...that's just silly. newlinechar  newlinechar The big problem with Kucinich and Gravel is that they want socialism. That's an easy path that doesn't require self-reliance and will lead to tyranny. Do you really think we are at our best when the state takes most of our income in taxes and spends it as American politicians deem best? That's a fool's dream my friend.

I'm in a slightly different boat, as I'm a rock climber, but I'd imagine it's much the same for both. I got to know people from the local scene when I was starting out and learned everything I could from them. I also read everything I could get my hands on; there are a number of classic mountaineering books describing every aspect of a climb. newlinechar  newlinechar From there it was just practice - my friend and I started out with a rope, harnesses, a length of webbing and a few biners toproping at our local cliffs. Over time we picked up gear based upon our needs; a set of nuts here, some cams there, etc, and started dabbling in lead climbing. newlinechar  newlinechar Over time my experience grew, and I started attempting longer, harder, more dangerous routes. Right now I'm working on my aid climbing skills in preparation for a push up El Capitan this coming summer or next (we may hit up the face of half dome first, but one of the two at the very least). newlinechar  newlinechar So I guess the answer is, it comes gradually. Gear looks expensive at face value, but when you spread it out over many years it's not that much money. When it comes to taking on a rock like El Capitan, or a mountain like Everest, it's just one step at a time. I kept on looking for harder, longer climbs with more exposure and crazier surroundings, and one day I realized I was at the level to be attempting some of these defining faces.

&gt;Largely due to the user interface. It has to be learned, but it's simple, hard to forget and rarely changes. The same cannot be said for computers. newlinechar  newlinechar I honestly don't think a person who has used nothing but Win95 since it came out would have much trouble using a WinXP box.  Even a Win 3.1 user could probably pick it up in a matter of a day or so. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;A car is used for getting from point A to B, while a computer does so much more. newlinechar  newlinechar In theory, you're right.  In practice, the typical office user performs the same small handful of computer tasks 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for the duration of their career.

I can understand a first-time driver not knowing that the reason they can't see at night is they have to turn the headlights on - *once*.  Having to be reminded roughly once every 2 - 3 months...WTF?

No the real issue is the Kirchsteur (Church tax). The German law not only grants churches tax privileges as in the US but it will automatically deduct tax (tithes) from those registered to that faith. This can add up to quite a lot.

Suppose we assume what you say is true. newlinechar  newlinechar (which has not been proven, NOR even alleged by the prosecution.) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Then, in this worst-case-picture, he plans to drive buddies to rob someone. Thus, he is guilty of robbery, by being a direct accomplice. He knew what they were going to do, they had planned so and so criminal activity, and boom. Now, there is something to be said about appearences. If his friends were living psychopaths but somehow he wasn't aware of this, then he truly is innocent as an angel. If he knew they had violent tendencies, then he shares some responsibility for their actions, for he is an enabler. If he knew they were homocidal maniacs, then he is guilty as sin. Not one of these facts is proven. If we wanted to try him for mens rea (state of mind), then we HAVE to set a trial for that component of argument. We can't give him a trial for a bullshit legal construct that EVERY court in almost EVERY country and almost EVERY STATE COURT IN THE UNITED STATES has deemed as complete bogus, and then fault him for different reasons.

It's the first bullet point, not the second. Sort of. As I understand it (IANAL) I have to pursue infringers when they come to my attention, or it can be argued that I've let the copyrights lapse. Perhaps I'm getting this mixed up with trademark law (like Hormel sued people to stop them from using Spam in technology products.. trademark dilution). I'll have to doublecheck the laws. But as others have argued, my trademarks ('trade dress' as embodied in my website look and feel) were also infringed.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know about the second point, I don't think there's a time restriction, as long as the infringement is ongoing (in this example, a website continues to post infringing work). Sure you could use the DMCA as a 'perpetual copyright' if you file false claims beyond the expiration of the original copyright, but that is illegal, now there's a term for it, 'copyfraud.' The DMCA doesn't extend copyrights, it merely provides a fast track for enforcing them.

By 'obfuscating the question' I meant the issue of household salary vs college educated male salary, brought up by someone else, not you. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Per capita hours worked have only increased by 6 minutes/day, so it's likely that most of these men are working less than their 1970 counterparts (any idea where to get good data on this?). newlinechar  newlinechar Right, averaged across the population. But as the Businessweek article claims, the hours of college educated males have worsened a lot, yet their salaries have remained flat. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So now, women/nonwhites get a bigger piece of the labor pie, and white men get less. What's the big deal? newlinechar  newlinechar The big deal is probably that while males probably provide a reference worker, sort of a lab rat of a typical full time employed worker relatively free of social upheaval. So the income of the educated reference worker has fallen a bit, whereas (if you believe the Businessweek article) his hours have increased. newlinechar  newlinechar By bringing the rise of household income into the equation, one (not you personally) obfuscates this fact by introducing the fact of social upheaval and increasing female participation in the workforce.  newlinechar  newlinechar Or another way to look at is whether the real median income per hour has fallen. We are no longer looking at white males vs minorities, or females. Just raw income per hour worked. newlinechar  newlinechar This source: http://local.google.com/answers/threadview?id=718907 newlinechar contains a few not quite satisfactory refs. The conclusion is basically that median wages stagnated, but men have fallen and women have risen. newlinechar  newlinechar Another good figure would be to compare the median wage with per-capita GDP, which would say whether the typical worker is getting the same share of the pie. I'm pretty sure that real per-capita GDP has risen, which would mean that the median worker is getting a shrinking part of the pie.

I'm not defending the above statements made by anyone else.  But conflict resolution through violence isn't automatically terrorism.  There is principled struggle, like when your land is invaded and an occupying force kills your father, and you try to resist the occupation and the further killing of other peoples fathers.  That's not terrorism, that's resistance. newlinechar  newlinechar In principle, the resistance of the erosion of civil liberties isn't terrorism by definition either.

It's not a position or a principle of struggle.  Please be careful about how you throw that new phrase around.  New legal definitions are being written to make it a very sharp legal tool.

The U.S. government officials and some journalists deny the charges on several grounds. They maintain that the U.S. supported only the indigenous Afghan mujahideen; that with a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamilar with the local language, customs or lay of the land; that with several hundred million a year in funding from Muslim non-American sources, Arab Afghans themselves would have no need for American funds; that American's could not train mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jouvenal.[10]; that the Afghan Arabs were militant Islamists with who were reflexively hostile to Westerners whether the Westerners were helping the mujahideen or not. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri says much the same thing in his book Knights Under the Prophet's Banner.[11] Bin Laden himself has said 'the collapse of the Soviet Union ... goes to God and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ... the US had no mentionable role,' but 'collapse made the US more haughty and arrogant.' [12] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar According to CNN journalist Peter Bergen, known for conducting the first television interview with Osama bin Laden in 1997, newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The story about bin Laden and the CIA -- that the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden -- is simply a folk myth. There's no evidence of this. In fact, there are very few things that bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and the U.S. government agree on. They all agree that they didn't have a relationship in the 1980s. And they wouldn't have needed to. Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently. The real story here is the CIA did not understand who Osama was until 1996, when they set up a unit to really start tracking him.[13] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Bergen quotes Pakistani Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, who ran ISI's Afghan operation between 1983 and 1987: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It was always galling to the Americans, and I can understand their point of view, that although they paid the piper they could not call the tune. The CIA supported the mujahideen by spending the taxpayers' money, billions of dollars of it over the years, on buying arms, ammunition, and equipment. It was their secret arms procurement branch that was kept busy. It was, however, a cardinal rule of Pakistan's policy that no Americans ever become involved with the distribution of funds or arms once they arrived in the country. No Americans ever trained or had direct contact with the mujahideen, and no American official ever went inside Afghanistan.[14] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Other sources also dispute the notion that the CIA had any contact with non-Afghan mujahideen[15] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Vincent Cannistraro, who led the Reagan administration's Afghan Working Group from 1985 to 1987, puts it, 'The CIA was very reluctant to be involved at all. They thought it would end up with them being blamed, like in Guatemala.' So the Agency tried to avoid direct involvement in the war, ... the skittish CIA, Cannistraro estimates, had less than ten operatives acting as America's eyes and ears in the region. Milton Bearden, the Agency's chief field operative in the war effort, has insisted that '[T]he CIA had nothing to do with' bin Laden. Cannistraro says that when he coordinated Afghan policy from Washington, he never once heard bin Laden's name. [16] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Other reasons for the lack of any CIA-Afghan Arab connection let alone the regarding of it as of 'pivotal importance' was that the Afghan Arabs were in reality a 'curious sideshow to the real fighting.'[17] Estimates are that there were about a 250,000 Afghans fighting 125,000 Soviet troops, while only 2000 Arab Afghans fought 'at any one time', [18] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Marc Sageman, a Foreign Service Officer who was based in Islamabad from 1987-1989, and worked closely with Afghanistan's Mujahideen, says newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Contemporaneous accounts of the war do not even mention [the Afghan Arabs]. Many were not serious about the war. ... Very few were involved in actual fighting. For most of the war, they were scattered among the Afghan groups associated with the four Afghan fundamentalist parties.[19] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar According to Milton Bearden the CIA did not recruit Arabs because there were hundreds of thousands of Afghans all too willing to fight. The Arab Afghan were not only superfluous but 'disruptive' angering local Afghan with there more-Muslim-than-thou attitude.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jouvenal.[20] Veteran Afghan cameraman Peter Jouvenal quotes an Afghan mujahideen as saying 'whenever we had a problem with one of them [foreign mujahideen], we just shot them. They thought they were kings.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Many who traveled in Afghanistan - Olivier Roy,[21] Peter Jouvenal.[22] - reported of the Arab Afghans' visceral hostility to Westerners there to aid Afghans or report on their plight. BBC reporter John Simpson tells the story of running into Osama bin Laden in 1989, and with neither knowning who the other were, bin Laden attempting to bribe Simpson's Afghan driver $500 - a large sum in a poor country - to kill the infidel Simpson. When the driver declined, Bin Laden retired to his 'camp bed' and wept 'in frustration.' [23] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

The government's 911 Commission Report outlines a massive conspiracy. It's just the official conspiracy theory. Here's the definition of a conspiracy:  newlinechar  newlinechar 1.  An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act. newlinechar 2. A group of conspirators. newlinechar 3. Law. An agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime or accomplish a legal purpose through illegal action. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That means that when the government says 19 people got together and attacked various targets around the country simultaneously, they are outlining a conspiracy. It also happens to be a bad conspiracy theory, because it doesn't fit with all the available data. How in our great nation did two planes hit the trade center one our apart from each other (we'll ignore the Pentagon for simplicity)? Someone in the Air Force chain of command had to tell fighter planes to stand down when the second plane went off course. That means either someone should have been court martialed for gross negligence or there are conspirators at large to this very day who helped circumvent standard Air Force protocol.

What's sad is how the Bush administration is either incredibly ignorant about torture - or doesn't care. newlinechar  newlinechar You don't need to hurt someone to torture them.  I've been reading recently about the techniques perfected during the 1960's and 1970's with mental patients (some who came in for depression, only to be experimented on by released CIA docs). newlinechar  newlinechar They put people in dark rooms, covered their hands so they couldn't touch anything, and blared music at them at all or odd hours.  Prevented them from sleeping.  Shifted their feeding, and kept people disoriented for weeks at a time.  Maybe throw in some simulated drowning, or massive insulin shots to induce temporary comas, or some electroshock therapy as often as 6 times a day.   newlinechar  newlinechar The finding?  You could really fuck somebody up this way - and not lay a hand on them!  Keep it up long enough (and keep them from sleeping, for as long as possible), and you'd get them to admit to *anything* without laying a fist on them. newlinechar  newlinechar Though, afterwards, the patients would be mentally scarred for life, have difficulty holding down jobs, in some cases become infants again, suffer life-long memory issues, etc, etc, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Sound at *all* sound familiar to what's happening today with 'enhanced interrogation techniques'?  Perhaps it should - and for Bush and company to say 'Hey, it's just roughing them up a little - there's no threat to organ failure here, so it's not torture' shows that they are willfully ignorant as to what torture is - or they're evil enough to care, but do it any way. newlinechar  newlinechar Side note: I know the article is about the legal status of the people being held as 'enemy combatants' and 'terrorists', but the torture thing is as disturbing to me as is the violation of their civil rights.

&gt; Project Manhattan had thousands of people working on it all over the country, and it never leaked. newlinechar  newlinechar Clearly it has leaked, because you and I both know about it.

Its been 6 years and all we have is one person coming forward (Sibel Edmonds) and thats not even direct testimony to actions, but sounds more like suspicions she has. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Estimates are that only 20 powerful people or so would have had to know the whole plot; newlinechar  newlinechar I find it hard to believe that 20 people were able to orchestrate such a convincing plot. I can accept that many others only knew part of it, but one of them could come forward and say something was out of the ordinary for them. newlinechar  newlinechar I admit that the rich (likely neocons) people behind any such plot would greatly benefit from it, but I still question the ability to keep a lid on the events so well. Even considering to hatch such a plan would have been a risk not worth taking, because during the planning phase, it would have taken only involving one wrong person and everything would have come apart and destroyed their network.  newlinechar  newlinechar Its a risk that isn't worth taking when they have other safer means to cheat the people. I'd like to see how anyone can address this point, because its not like they couldn't grab power before 9/11, because they did. Its not like they couldn't cheat people out of money before 9/11, because they did. So the risk of such a plan to such a small cabal of planners isn't worth it and therefore there is no motive that can't be explained away as too risky.

Well, the Founding Fathers had what you hinted at in mind. The problem is, it is too far gone. Slowly but surely we lost what was 'America.'

No one is arguing that illegal immigrants are hard working people, they are.  That's not the point.  Our current GROWTH is unsustainable, we need to slow down our population growth.  And maybe if we didn't have illegal labor and made people pay decent wages for labor we wouldn't have so many idle teens.
I also wonder if it's always been this way and I've never noticed because I didn't pay much attention to politics. I think both are true.

We can't feel sorry for LA because the populous is too think-headed to do anything good for itself. Portland does a fine job of planning their city for explosive growth. Massive public transit projects that actually pay off with clean facilities and safe streets. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want a better-planned city, then you have to move to one. LA isn't going to fix itself over night. I personally hate LA and the way they planned it. Just look at the highways and inefficient land use.

Just to be clear, if your EC2 instance crashes, it is *gone*.  No disk to even attempt to recover, nothing.  That can happen to 'real' machines too, but it's very unlikely across 2 or 3 - within the realm of acceptable risk for a smallish company with good backups. newlinechar  newlinechar Like I said, EC2 seems ok as a way to increase capacity by adding to existing infrastructure, but not something you would want to use exclusively. newlinechar  newlinechar At the very least, you'd need some kind of command/control/monitoring system outside of it - but perhaps we agree on this point.

They already contribute in taxes.  That's not the point, the growth is the problem.  We need to have sustainable growth.  Right now California is running out of water as is much of the southwest because we don't have enough water for the people that are already here.  We need sustainable growth and manage it so we can plan for it.  Right now it's just a mess our infrastructure can't keep up with the influx of people.

&gt;It's a programming language designed to suit  newlinechar &gt;management. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually no.  There was a lot of academic and developer take-up of Java when it started, and with good reason. newlinechar  newlinechar I used to be a Smalltalk developer.  It was great, but then the versions (VisualWorks and VisualAge) that (at the time) had reasonable performance and cross-platform portability were priced out of my range.  I looked around for a development language that met my criteria: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Had garbage collection (after a decade of using C and C++, I never wanted to do manual memory management ever again) newlinechar 2. Was reasonably OOP. newlinechar 3. Was cross-platform (at the stage of deployment, not just for compiling) newlinechar 4. Did not cost too much. newlinechar 5. Was available from different vendors, so I did not have too much 'tie in'. newlinechar 6. Had reasonable performance. newlinechar 7. Was not horribly obscure, so my code could be passed on others, or I could easily build a team. newlinechar  newlinechar Commercial Smalltalks had matched these criteria, but failed 4 when they got to the stage of per-processor deployment charges that involved a percentage of company profits (I kid you not). newlinechar  newlinechar The fact is that Smalltalk attempted suicide in the mid-to-late 90s.  Fortunately, it did not quite succeed, but what was left did not suit my needs.  Java did, and it did for thousands of other developers at that time.  To say 'its a programming language designed to suit management' is just an easy and sloppy jibe.

Tony has one of the most obnoxious, and inane, ways of arguing I've ever come across. The first time I saw him make the argument that pure functional programming is the only correct way to program computers because reality is fundamentally immutable (as space-time in the theory of relativity is a static object rather than a dynamic process) I thought he was making an elaborate joke; turns out he was dead serious.  newlinechar  newlinechar What makes this experience singular is that I agree with many of his conclusions, but his reasons are so utterly opposed in both outline and detail to my own (which are grounded in empirical benefits, though these often have a theoretical backing); it is religion in almost the literal sense of the term.

Doesn't matter. It still perfectly refutes your claim that the only population growth is from illegal immigrants, and that the birth rate is lower than the death rate.  newlinechar  newlinechar The entire worlds population is growing, the United States included.

Because it is an infectious disease and thus has the potential to turn into a epidemic if not countered.

This is the key difference. newlinechar  newlinechar This claim from the article is not logical: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Federal funding for HIV/AIDS has increased dramatically every year since 1993, yet the number of new infections has not declined. Why do we spend more money every year on prevention programs that have failed to prevent new infections? newlinechar  newlinechar The infection rate hasn't declined, but it could be much higher if we hadn't spent anything.
Hey Tony, newlinechar  newlinechar The only statement in the above that to my knowledge is not a direct paraphrase of something you've said is the space-time thing, which was more my interpretation of what you tried to say.

I'm glad I'm not a designer.  While the software you mentioned are good, they are highly proprietary, and I'm extremely happy that I don't have to use them to get any work done.

It's still not true.

The reason it's voted down (or was) is because, while the cdr of a dotted list is not a list, it is still the cdr and not a car.   'car' and 'cdr' are the first and second elements of a cons respectively.  In a normal list the car of each cons points to a value and the cdr of that cons either points to the next cons in the list, or, if the cons is the last in the list, the cdr is 'nil'.

&gt;Whether government and corporations are intertwined is a completely separate issue from whether the government has any effect on the economy. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't see how you can even think such a thing. Especially since you did not elaborate in any way on how these two things are not the same. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It's often companies acting in their own self-interest that push for deregulation, that will allow themselves greater profits, without additional benefit for consumers. newlinechar  newlinechar Wrong again. Companies are pushed to create things that people will want to buy in successively greater numbers. Other companies, meanwhile, are pushed to compete with them. The driving force here is *efficiency*, and consumers have direct benefit because they can buy more for less. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Who benefits from a completely unregulated marketplace? Who suffers? newlinechar  newlinechar Companies benefit first by being free to seek profit in any way they want. The people benefit second by being offered a larger choice of products/services, at higher and higher quality and lower and lower prices through the forces of competition and natural selection. The only ones who suffer are corrupt politicians. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The best countries in the world to live in overwhelmingly follow social-democratic principles. newlinechar  newlinechar Quality of life is not always related to freedom. You've never read any science fiction books? There's a reason they all portray utopian dictatorship societies as BAD things, and people who rise up against the utopia to take back their freedom (even at the expense of lowering the quality of life) as heroes. The reason they are portrayed like that in fiction is because men have an innate desire to be free, even at the expense of personal well-being. Ask yourself: *Would you rather be free and poor, or rich and repressed?* newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This is an economic approach that has proven itself empirically. newlinechar  newlinechar Only because a fully libertarian approach has **never** been attempted (i.e. when the entire society is libertarian, not just one or two small segments of it). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Do you have evidence...  newlinechar  newlinechar There have, in fact, been *many* studies that conclude that libertarian theories would produce the most optimal results. Libertarianism does not exist in a vacuum. It is a thoroughly-researched topic. While I can't point you to any *one* piece of evidence, start on websites like mises.org and work your way up. Libertarian groups routinely publish findings and honest-to-goodness studies and research that support their beliefs.

I said *I* always found the GIMP easy to use, even after using Photoshop. newlinechar  newlinechar Then again, I always loved MS Paint as well, since it's great for pixel art.  Now that I've moved to GNU/Linux, I use KolourPaint, but I guess that's beside the point. newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, the reason I *prefer* to use open source software is because I hate vendor lock-in.  I want to be Free, thank you very much. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not wrong to say, 'I prefer Photoshop over OSS.'  It's just a different set of values.
Why? For stuff like this you get way better cross browser support. Plus, there's significantly less memory and performance overhead. If you don't need any of the interactivity then Canvas is definitely the way to go.

I agree, I dont see how its different from people standing on the sideof the street handing out pamphlets.  These supporters are just trying to get his name exposed to more people because the MSM wont cover him.  No doubt a sizable number of people will jump aboard when they are forced to look at what he stands for.  I would have a problem with it if it was the actual campaign doing it.  His campagin doesnt do any solicitation, so that should tell you how desireable his ideas are right now.

He was Santa (although a bit too southern!) to poor kids. He opened non-profit computer labs in urban areas. He donated a lot of his money to charity. newlinechar  newlinechar Edwards has been the most detailed and honest in his proposals. He's been more out-spoken on issues than ANY other candidate. He might beat Clinton's money or Obama's vague idealism, but boy does he make me proud.

Thanks for that! I follow major US politics fairly closely, and I'd never even heard of Larry Agran. Just goes to show how easy it is for the media to completely exclude potential candidates. The '92 POTUS election was should've been interesting from the standpoint that, (unlike the current '08 election farce), there were actually quite a few potential candidates that had reasonably good ideas, and most of the better ones were convinced not to even seek nominations, because they weren't the preordained, anointed 'winah'.

GC makes easy things easier, it makes hard things easier, at the cost of making the _really_ freakin' hard things even harder. Broadly, it's a good trade in the vast majority of circumstances, but that doesn't add up to the GC 'never worry about memory leaks  again' marketing.

I'm not going to give the common answers of 'those are crazy people', I believe that money and sex makes the world go around and can explain just about everything. Also, I accept that there are assassination in this day and age, so no argument here. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I agree with you, 'Cui bono?' is the right question to ask.  newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree, I think of the true question differently and I don't think you'll disagree.  newlinechar  newlinechar The rich already benefit from most things and they have most of the money and the power currently in the US. The rich have usually always been wealthy and much of the recent millionairs will likely lose their wealth just as quickly as they gained it. The real wealth and power will still be concentrated in the 1% that has always had the wealth. newlinechar  newlinechar So the current rich have their money and they have the true power to manipulate affairs within the world. So truly who benefits from 9/11 and a power grab? Definitely not the established rich people, they're already rich remember. So only a poor person with some power would orchestrate a plan like this. Not a 'poor' person in our terms, but poor compared to the established wealthy 1%. newlinechar  newlinechar So a conspiracy theory to grab power is grabbing it away from who? Is it grabbing it away not from the 99% of the world poor people? Someone didn't orchestrate 9/11 to steal power away from some hillbilly living in a trailer in Mississippi! They did this to steal power away from the wealthy 1% and the wealthy 1% wouldn't be likely to roll over and give it up easily. newlinechar  newlinechar So who are the possible choices for taking the power away from the rich? We have either Osama bin Laden, leading a poor ragtag element or some fat cat neocons put into power by the wealthy 1% to begin with. newlinechar  newlinechar So I counter all your arguments with the notion that the wealthy 1% already controlled everything before 9/11 and they had the neocons as their puppets. They in no way benefited from causing 9/11, they have lots of easier ways to manipulate things.
So why the difference? Why collapse arrays at all? newlinechar  newlinechar So now, we have 2 array syntaxs, one 'auto-collapsing' and one that preserves nesting. newlinechar  newlinechar So how much this can screw up n00bs, and programmers trying to learn perl? newlinechar  newlinechar Now, how do these differ in different contexts?

Most girls get fake boobies out of a lack of self-esteem, and or dissatisfaction with their bodies.

Upmodded because you make a semi point.  However, I don't carry pills around with me everywhere I go.  I just avoid going to places with dogs (dog shows, kennels, etc).

&gt;Tobacco companies for years touted the health benefits of smoking. They were proven to be lying.

Do you want to prevent people from hurting themselves? Do you want to outlaw drugs? Do you want to outlaw unhealthy diets? No more chocolate and sugar? Not more red meat? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The dairy industry today promotes misinformation regarding the health effects of its products, and happily gets away with it. newlinechar  newlinechar If there is any study that is published in the press claiming that dairy products are unhealthy, I promise you that the dairy industry's profits will suffer. What will they be forced to do then? Increase the quality of their products. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Companies sell magnetic bracelets, homeopathic remedies, chiropractic services, and numerous other completely discredited pseudo-medical products, and still make millions. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't see any problems with that. People are free to spend their money in any way that they wish. Education about these products is readily available, especially thanks to the internet, one of the most libertarian places you will *ever* encounter in our modern world. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The fact is, the average consumer lacks the education to make fully informed purchasing decisions. They aren't experts in medicine, nutrition, engineering, law, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar No, they're not experts, but being informed isn't that difficult. Countless private consumer-reporting organizations exist that review products, issue warnings, etc. What's wrong with people paying more attention to what they buy? They're spending their earnings on things -- they *should* pay attention. And if the government stops holding their hand as they walk blind through a dangerous world, they *will* pay attention. This is a good thing. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;What is reasonable for a community to do, is say 'We're being sold crap. Please hire some experts and evaluate products for safety and stop the worst from being sold.' newlinechar  newlinechar No. What is reasonable for a community to do, is say, 'We're being sold crap. Let's stop buying their products. We will gladly purchase a subscription to Consumer Reports for $20 a year, and in the future avoid buying bad products.' *That* is reasonable. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But by and large the results have shown themselves to be an improvement. newlinechar  newlinechar An improvement over what? The only libertarian society to ever exist in the world has been the internet. You can't compare the status quo to something that has never before been put into practice. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;What is the mindset that leads one to think a completely anarchic marketplace, where anything goes, is a good idea? newlinechar  newlinechar It is this mindset: newlinechar  newlinechar **'Any society that will give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both.' - Benjamin Franklin**

Really you would have to show that someone told the terrorist to attack that day, because it was the semiannual exercise period.

Corporate media has nothing to do with it.

Yeah, I'm sure I'd be living the good life in 1933 if I could find a job back then making my current salary.  newlinechar  newlinechar Oh wait, in 1933 minimum wage was 25 cents an hour.  I guess things were a little different across the board back then.  newlinechar  newlinechar Comparing 1933 dollars to 2007 dollars is pretty much completely useless. Sure, you could buy a lot more with a dollar in that era, but you would probably be very lucky to make $1,000 in a year. If goods are worth 14.2 times as much now, so is your labor. newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly, I'd rather have a relatively stable economy with inflation than try to permanently fix the value of the dollar to some meaningless amount.

Many lawyers get rich representing corporations; many lawyers get rich suing corporations ([such as John Edwards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edwards#Legal_career)).  According to the American Bar Association, there were [over 1,100,000 lawyers practicing in America in 2006 (pdf)](http://www.abanet.org/marketresearch/lawyer_demographics_2006.pdf) and in 2000, 74% worked in private practice (presumably some for corporations), 8% in private industry, and 1% in legal aid/public defense.  Maybe it's just me, but the increase in litigation seems related to the rise of corporate power in this country. newlinechar  newlinechar Edwards has achieved impassioned legal wins for injured people.  However his for-it-before-he-was-against-it record raises questions.  [Edwards voted for the PATRIOT Act and for the Iraq war before he was against both, voted for liberalized trade with China before he was against it (when the lead toys hit the fan), and voted for storing nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain before he was against it](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/30/AR2007113001785.html).  Dennis Kucinich doesn't have this problem--he voted against the PATRIOT Act, voted against the Iraq war, voted against funding the Iraq war, voted against unfair trade agreements.  When Kucinich changes his stance (such as shifting from pro-life to pro-choice), [he explains how he got there](http://www.ontheissues.org/2004/Dennis_Kucinich_Abortion.htm); when Edwards changes his stance, he pretends he's always thought that way and ignores when others call him on it.

This may sound racist but it was also when it was under white colonization. When it got overthrown, or rather voted out, Mugabe and his regime went insane and drove out absolutely every single white person. Farmers, academics, politicians, scientists - Gone. Then began the fall of his country because no one was equipped with knowledge on how to sustain their agricultural industries, stability and the economy. This is significantly in part due to the racist apartheid policies of the British though which led to having less black Zimbabweans educated on how to manage their country.

While I respect his ability to freely choose his metaphysical system, I can't help but hold the position that it says a lot about his ability to come to sound conclusions when he believes in something as absurd and asinine as Mormonism.  One of my best friends comes from a Mormon family are they good people who seem to embody their faith well.  However, being a good person doesn't qualify you for the office of president and I fear the logical missteps such a president could make who allows his brain to believe such a fundamentalist doctrine.

Don't forget that the possibility exists for someone to come up with a super-fast way to implement whatever algorithm you might use.  As far as I'm concerned, N rounds of SHA-256 or Whirlpool is as good as bcrypt, scalable, and much easier to get right.  Specifically, those algorithms are built into everyone's frameworks already. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't disagree with you, except in salt being a 'band-aid'.  A good design has 'layers' as you said yourself, and includes both a slow digest algorithm and salt, among other things.  Each one protects you in a different way from a different set of attacks, and all are necessary if you're serious about security. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, you also have to consider transport security (sending the password in the clear to be hashed on the server is ridiculous, but all too common), database/backup security (if you can keep anyone from getting your database in the first place, then they never get to try your encryption), etc..
That is exactly what I'm trying to say.  This type of service should be required by law, but instead the gov't prefers to protect the interests of the credit reporting agencies and only require that they give 1 free credit check per year.

Anything that is slightly different will be seized upon but IMHO it's not a hate crime unless that was the driving factor in the attack.

&gt;Marriage provides a much stronger bond (even though there is divorce) than a simple verbal 'hey let's live together.' newlinechar  newlinechar But that bond is purely legal.  It's basically saying 'If you leave me, I'm permitted by law to take half of our stuff.'  It does nothing to increase or decrease the *actual* bond between the people involved.  They don't love one another more.  It's just an artificial construct by which the state can make it more difficult (and more painful) to break that bond. newlinechar  newlinechar So, from the point of view of raising children, marriage is, itself, of little value.  It's the strong bonds that tend to *result* in marriage that are beneficial.  As I mentioned before, marriage is an *effect* of good families, not a cause. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If there is a choice between being adopted by a single parent and a couple, I choose the couple (all else being equal). If the choice is between a same-sex couple and a married couple (all else equal) I choose the married couple. newlinechar  newlinechar In which case I fail to see how gay marriage is an issue at all.  The case workers assigned to handle this stuff are charged with doing what's in the best interest of the child.  Gay couples aren't suddenly going to start overwhelming straight couples in the adoption processes if they're allowed to marry. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, the fact is that not every child available to be adopted is actually adopted.  So even *if* gay marriage made it more likely that gay couples could adopt children, it would still mean that fewer children are being left in foster care, so it's a beneficial situation for the children.

&gt;Make anything dangerous like that a prescription only drug. You're still going to have people abusing it, but in far fewer numbers.

They shouldn't create them.  Here, take this.  It will make you sick.  That's not what prescription drugs should be. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There's tons of stuff one can take that can cause permanent harm. What about sniffing glue? Should we ban glue too because it can be abused? newlinechar  newlinechar Just like the prescription drugs, glue has another purpose other than getting people high.

It wouldn't be that simple. *You* may not for instance be an AT&amp;T customer, but they own a helluva lot of fiber so at some point your traffic (or traffic to *your* site) is bound to run through their infrastructure and without net neutrality they could throttle it as they wish.

You're both missing the point. The back button is neither an undo button nor an edit button, it is a BACK button. I want to go BACK to what I was just doing a second ago, and do it again. newlinechar  newlinechar Whether that means posting a new entry or editing an existing entry is up to the application, but from a usability point of view anyone who is immediately going back to what they just posted probably wants to edit it, not post a second entry with the same, slightly modified text. The application needs to take its users workflow into account. newlinechar  newlinechar You don't shoehorn people into your workflow, you fix your workflow to encompass what people want to do.

The underlying presumption is government knows better than the people.  Another way to say this is these 'progressives' feel they know what's best for the greater good.  This is Collectivism.  Socialism, Communism on the left, or Facism, Corporatism, and Dictatorships on the right, are all forms of Collectivism, which is the antithesis of Indivdualism, the basis of the Constitution('inaliable rights'.)  The indivdualist solution for this 'problem' would be that it's up to parents to monitor and filter their childrens internet access and instill their values.  Instead, here we have the collectivist 'solution' of killing off the internet for all for the 'greater good' of protecting the children.  It's why the only viable candidate I see is Ron Paul.

&gt; I doubt someone of your intellectual stature is writing from a library or university. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, obviously, insulting me lets everyone know your intellectual stature.

Shame on you for such juvenile insults. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Are you so blinded by bigotry that you can't read what your own research is telling you? newlinechar  newlinechar Again, insults.  How am I supposed to have a conversation with someone that already hates and insults people that disagree before the conversation begins.  Glad to hear that university of yours has opened your mind. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, the gist of your argument is that you claim that marriage is correlated with positive outcomes in children, and so that the marriage *and* the positive outcomes are probably caused by underlying behaviors and traits in that couple. newlinechar  newlinechar So given that you repeated the same argument over and over from you moral pedestal in between your insulting remarks, I can boil my response down to a a few points: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Marriage is not a continuous variable; statistically you cannot correlate an either/or, only numerical values. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Children of divorce are worse off than those of a married couple.  You'll probably argue that those divorced parents were more likely to get divorced and not stay married, etc, but that is silly. newlinechar  newlinechar The onus is on you to prove your thesis, considering it is much more parsimonious and it would be quite odd to think that no researcher had accounted for that.  And maybe while you are at it, you could treat those you differ with (including me) with civility instead of the condescension and insults you have chosen.  I know that's so tough when you are arguing from up on your pedastal, but I believe in you :). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

Perl builds upon the nature of a natural language environment -- Larry is a linguist.  Perl builds upon the UNIX environment in which it grew up.  Once you start to understand these things, learning Perl is an introduction to an entire 'ecosystem' -- or multiple ecosystems -- of design, including trade-offs.  Like a natural language, it's not the easiest thing to learn in depth, and it has nuances, but like a natural language, in Perl one has the ability to say a hell of a lot quite concisely.

&gt;the one man/multiple women marriage would be common in more cultures. So it would actually be more accurate to refer to polygamy as 'traditional' marriage. The whole idea of marriage for romantic love by itself is pretty new.  newlinechar  newlinechar I never said anything about romantic love, and frankly, polygamy is still 'man/woman.'  Why is that so hard?  Do you insist on trying to muddy waters to fit your ideology?  Conceding that fact isn't going to kill you, sheesh. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Anyone whose facts don't jibe with your opinions must be 'left-wing', eh? It's ironic that you're always the first one to accuse someone of bias. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, I am familiar with the studies conducted trying to prove that there were gay marriages in medeival societies, and frankly, considering that 70-80% of Academics are left-leaning... my assumptions are not off-base. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I encourage you to take the time to make your own argument instead of being lazy about it. newlinechar  newlinechar I apologize - they are *my* responses on this thread.  I am the only one arguing against it here :). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Why is gay marriage wrong? newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly, barring religion, it boils down to this concept.  The more I think about it, this is the single issue for me: newlinechar  newlinechar It has everything to do with children and the role of marriage in *our* society.  It is not specifically anti-same-sex marriage, but more pro-preserving our current definition of marriage. newlinechar  newlinechar Marriage is the best situation to raise a child in.  Men and women are also different in a host of ways, so in an optimal situation (and considering the research), having a biological mother and father in a married relationship is the *best* situation for a child to be in.  That doesn't mean a same-sex couple is not 'second best' which I believe it is.  I am *more* adamantly against single parenthood and angry divorces and out-of-wedlock births, frankly, because of their destructive nature on children. newlinechar  newlinechar But the point remains: having a married mother and father is best.  Expanding the current definition of marriage (since you barred the use of 'traditional' even though it is valid) to include more and more 'situations' muddies the waters and expands the situations children can be placed in, creating a host of new situations that are inferior for them to be brought up in. newlinechar  newlinechar That's all, really, and so if same-sex advocates could admit that scientifically and philosophically a married opposite-sex couple is better for children, I think I'd be more inclined to be sympathetic.  When someone wants new rights, it takes a lot of gall to declare a lot of things untrue that are.

Ok, I see you're a troll, should've known.  But I'll go ahead and comment.  I didn't say every urban poor person commits a crime, don't be purposely dense.  I said poor urban people commit crimes, and they do at a much higher rate than their rural counterparts, be they black white or whatever.  Cram people in a crowded, poor, urban environment with shitty schools and they will engage in a higher rate of criminal activity. You know a black kid that commits crimes and he's middle class?  Wonderful, would you like a cookie and a gold star for that ridiculous tripe of a troll statement. I know plenty of well off white kids that commit crimes.

You will only harden their belief.  Of course, there are those who will refuse to be persuaded, but they can be ignored, and quite easily.   newlinechar  newlinechar And since you seem to be under the impression that I'm of some faith, I'm not.

 newlinechar The difference between atheism and religion is that as an atheist I am not claiming anything, except that which can be determined or measured objectively.   newlinechar  newlinechar Religions, on the other hand, make many claims about the way thing are, and they do not back those claims up with evidence, which means that, at best, all of the claims of said religions are guesses.  The statistical probability that one of those religions got all of the things it claims correct by guessing is, to say the least, vanishingly small.  Therefore, it is almost impossible that any given religion *isn't* wrong.

Oof.  That's a long one =p  Alright, here goes: newlinechar  newlinechar I get what you're saying.  I completely understand, and I agree.  **But**, as I said to Skeptic already, attacking this through aggressive means won't help the situation, it will just divide us even farther.  While you may not want to be like Mitt Romney, I'd bet you want Mitt Romney to be a little bit more like you.  I think that's where my agreement ends though. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Claiming this stuff has nothing to do with religion makes as much sense as claiming evolution is just a theory. newlinechar  newlinechar Evolution *is* just a theory.  No scientist, anywhere, would claim it as fact, at least not in those exact words.  There is no *proof* of evolution, just an extreme amount of evidence.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There is a theory that religion is the culprit, and it is confirmed by millions of experiments. This makes it a scientific fact. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, there's really no such thing as scientific fact, and as far as those experiments go, I'm genuinely interested in hearing about them.  That kind of thing fascinates me, but being that I have a fair background in Psych and I haven't ever heard of one of those experiments, I have my doubts.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Btw, 'atheism' does not necessarily mean the opposite of such a belief system. In my life I've had enough of Marxism-Leninism which in Soviet interpretation became a bona fide religion exactly of the kind I hate. newlinechar  newlinechar Not sure what you mean there.  Could you elaborate a little? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Being tolerant to these religions is dangerous. I can turn my other cheek and you can, but for society it means disaster.  newlinechar  newlinechar Tolerance and turning the other cheek are two different things.  To be tolerant is to respect, to turn the other cheek is to ignore.  You can respect someone elses opinion while still trying to educate them about yours, especially if you have evidence to back yours up.  But the rest of that paragraph really *was* an overgeneralization and hyperbole ;) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I wouldn't call myself an atheist, though I'm also not an agnostic in the popular meaning of 'bible could be right'. I don't believe a deity could exist, but even if I would admit the possibility, I would never accept the worship-me fag-hating deity. I see where this stuff is coming from and it is not Heavens. newlinechar  newlinechar Exactly the same as myself =)

Who cares if he took many wives including 14 year old girls and women who already had husbands?

Oh yes, property() is unquestionably a good thing.  Encapsulation is a good thing, too, and I hope it didn't sound like I didn't think so.  I was just trying to say encapsulation, which is absolutely a good thing, doesn't necessarily mean compiler-enforced access rules, which I think are mostly superfluous. newlinechar  newlinechar After posting my comment above, I was trying to think of what compiler-enforced encapsulation could be good for, and I suppose it could guard against accidentally stomping on a private member.  There are doubtless other good cases to be made.   newlinechar  newlinechar But I was so surprised by how little compiler-enforced access rules mattered, after totally drinking the kool-aid about how  it was *essential* to good OO programming.

It's utter bullshit to think that these 'subprime' borrowers thought they could actually afford the houses they were picking up.  Everyone I know who used one of these mortgages was living in a Speculative dreamworld where house prices NEVER came down.  I personally know 2 people who have purchased multiple homes hoping to get rich.  They used ARMs to leverage as much of their assets as possible into real estate.  Meanwhile, I thought these people were crazy -- prices were completely unsupportable if looking at the fundamentals (such as local salaries).  If the government decides to bail out these folks, then I will be screwed twice: the market will not adjust, so I'll never be able to afford to buy my own home, and as a taxpayer I'll be on the hook for paying for the bailout.  Now, tell me, if I went to Las Vegas and gambled away a bunch of money on borrowed credit, would you be happy if the government made you pay my gambling debt?  Because that's EXACTLY what I think the government is asking taxpayers to do -- Pay for the speculative gamble of subprime borrowers.
Certainly not.  I think different factions are made up of different *proportions* of sensible or deluded people, or nice people or jerks, but every faction and philosophy has each of them. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, I've even known some dogmatic and intolerant people who characterised themselves as *Buddhists*, and I've known plenty of very nice Muslims and Christians. newlinechar  newlinechar Equally, I've met some really retarded and dogmatic fellow-atheists... newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, *any* club will attract a mix of people.

Languages inherently 'enforce,' in the sense of make it easy to program in, a certain style.  Python is about every solution being clean and easy to understand.  It's philosophy is that there's only one way to do something, the opposite of Perl's and Ruby's. newlinechar  newlinechar Take a look at other languages.  C and C++ are both about speed.  LISP is about modifying the language for the domain of the problem.

Once again, you're assuming that the populous has any meaningful power in society.  They have *none*.  They are also mindfucked into believing that they do, believing that if they just go vote for the Donkey, things will be different than with the Elephant. newlinechar  newlinechar In the US (and Canada, to a marginally lesser extent) people are largely informed through a consolidated mass media, gradually squeezed economically so they don't have energy to even think about politics, and fed myths about ways to Make a Difference that don't.  newlinechar  newlinechar Anti-war rally?  Writing letters?  When have those ever changed *anything*?   newlinechar  newlinechar If you're asking why there hasn't been a revolution (is that your question?), it's because people still have too much to lose, and don't realize how bad it is.  Any attempt to point out how bad it **is** will have been preemptively dismissed as a conspiracy theory by the consolidated media. newlinechar  newlinechar Umm, that was a long way of saying: Bread and Circuses.

That was for Afghanistan. I was even for that war and would have gladly gone to root out Al Qaeda as many did. However, the moving target to Iraq would require another vote. I was VERY against Iraq. My father was giving me a hard time how 85% of the country is for the Iraq war. I said to him then, as I do now. You cannot look at war as a popularity contest, it has to be started for valid reasons (retaliation in my opinion, not preemption). Now that I'm in the 85% he gets pissed. newlinechar  newlinechar Hell even here in backwards ass Oklahoma I no longer see all those stupid W stickers on everyone's cars.

There are other parameters accounted for how an article rises or falls on Reddit besides being upmodded/downmodded. (If it's upped/downed a lot its 'controversy' factor goes up).

Well, apparently you didn't have 'any sack.'   LOL! newlinechar  newlinechar The point is, you cannot accuse this guy DeFlumeri -- as the Marine Sgt did -- of sending others to do what he himself was not willing to do.  Because apparently that is not the case; apparently he served.  But without bothering to do the slightest fact checking, the Marine, and apparently many others, assumed that Brad DeFlumeri was simply another Republican chickenhawk, and that does not appear to have been the case with DeFlumeri.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are a lot of good arguments against the war, and there are a lot of times when calling a chickenhawk a chickenhawk is the right and proper thing to do.  But when you jump to conclusions and shoot your mouth off without having all the facts, you do more to undermine your own position that you do to best your opponent. newlinechar  newlinechar That's all.
I read a book on interview and interrogation techniques which suggested that even normal verbal interview techniques may appear to juries as tricking or harassing a suspect into a confession; showing a video of the interview in court even to prove that nothing untoward took place could bias a jury against the prosecution. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm still not sure how I feel about that line of reasoning, but with 'enhanced interrogation' now a reality in America, I agree that every move and sound an LEO makes in the presence of a suspect needs to be recorded for the public.

My personal host is on PHP5, and I do write PHP5 there, but I'm afraid where work is concerned I don't have any call over who our websites are hosted by, regardless of how much I try. newlinechar  newlinechar PHP isn't so bad, I really enjoy writing in it, there are a lot of holes but those are easily patched. newlinechar  newlinechar I've been over this before with reddit comments and people generally reply with 'Wow you just argued for both sides of the love/hate php crowds.' newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah I did, because I love and hate it, but I love it more. newlinechar  newlinechar As for Ruby, I really personally dislike it - not that you shouldn't write it, i just don't enjoy it like I do PHP. newlinechar  newlinechar But I do like Python a lot.
I think you just did a circular reference.. Anyway, yes this method is pretty old, it's called sprite.  newlinechar  newlinechar But honestly, it's always a bad Idea to use images to represent text.

&gt;People that make the choice to make that extra commitment are more likely, though I can't speak for anyone, to have 'more love' for each other newlinechar  newlinechar Which is exactly what I've been saying!  Pay careful attention to the wording you just used.  People who choose to get married are likely to have 'more love' for each other.  The 'more love' isn't the result of the marriage.  The marriage is the result of the 'more love'.  Marriage is a *result* of good relationships, not the cause. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If it wasn't so important, why are people arguing for same-sex marriage inclusion!? newlinechar  newlinechar I wouldn't argue that it isn't important in a broader sense.  It grants specific legal rights, and is one method that gives an easy way to describe a monogamous relationship. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But what if there are two equal couples - one same-sex and one married opposite-sex? Would you give preference? newlinechar  newlinechar Nope.  I also wouldn't give preference to couples over single parents.  Everything should be handled on a case-by-case basis. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;if not, why not, considering both the research and the logical fact that a man and woman are different... newlinechar  newlinechar I don't need research to tell me that.  However, not having a parent of one particular sex doesn't rule out having role model of that sex.  Aunts, uncles, family friends, etc.  That is something that the case worker would take into consideration.  I would never preclude someone from adopting based *solely* on their orientation, though.

Torture happens. It happens in police stations. It happens on the field. It happens in secret prisons. You can't reliably stop people on the front line from doing these things. newlinechar  newlinechar But you can make sure that people are held responsible for doing it and punished. There's a huge difference between human rights abuses by individuals, which are a part of the real world, and human rights abuses by institutions, even on a 'turning a blind eye' basis. newlinechar  newlinechar Torture with government support is where we are now. It's a very different thing from a couple of out of control cops who wind up in court later.

See this is what bothers me about the story.  The facts aren't laid out, basically people are considered guilty until proven innocent.  I don't know enough about this story, but I do know enough to know that an angry mob is never a good thing.

I never said you should.  If you like Lisp (or whatever), use it.  If you don't, don't.  I like Lisp and Perl and use them.  I don't like C++ and don't use it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar One the other hand I learned quite a lot of C++ and used it on the job for about 2 years.  How much Lisp do you know? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My point is (kind of) that the existence of your question proves my (our?  (mine and Larry's)) point.  Lots of people consider Lisp unsuitable for them, at least in part because of the popular view of Lisp as a language 'not for mere mortals'.  A lot of Lispers, since they know Lisp, must ergo not be 'mere mortals' (in their own minds), and revel in it.  A lot of people try to puncture that Smug Lisp Weenie attitude.  The whole interaction has been going on for a while, and Larry's remark summarizes it pretty well, I think. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In reality, you can ignore a lot of the corners of Lisp and do some very interesting work.  If you have a good implementation you can do some serious system interaction.  And comp.lang.lisp is a pretty friendly forum, in my experience.  So I, for one, do not consider Lisp a language 'not for mere mortals', having learned about it in my teens and written an interpreter for it, but I will grant you that most Lisp implementations do not cater to (that is, do not bend over backwards to conform to) the (often unconscious) preconceived notions of people coming to it from C or Java or the like.

The dominant frames on reddit tend to be libertarian and liberal (in a global context - I understand the American political mainstream is quite narrow and skewed to the right), but the community in general seems to be willing to correct its own errors.  newlinechar  newlinechar Hence, after the outpouring of panic yesterday about the new internet legislation, this post comes along to dispel the panic and provide better context.

Actually, the manner in which our drug policy kills is not yet incineration, but the fact is that our drug policy does kill.  And in great numbers. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider all of those who are denied medicine they and their doctors say is vital to their recovery. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider all of the research that has been terminated and results censored that might have yielded cures for some of our most deadly diseases. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider all of the HIV/AIDS and other diseases that are spread by intravenous drug use only because our drug policy forbids people access to clean needles. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider the fact too that our drug policy actually promotes the most deadly and addictive drugs, alcohol and tobacco, while using violence to deter the use of far safer and less addictive drugs, like marijuana and ecstasy. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider the wars we fight.  Both overseas, as in Colombia or Afghanistan, or here at home on our streets, all because of our drug policy. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider the people we allow to remain in power by virtue alone of the way our drug policy enriches them.  An especially disturbing case of this happened recently in Burma/Myanmar.  Look at how many people they killed. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider all of the non-violent drug offenders we lock up in prison, lock up with violent felons, and who are then beaten and raped and contract HIV/AIDS and then when released go on to spread it to others. newlinechar  newlinechar It's hard to add all these numbers up.  No way we can do an exact count. newlinechar  newlinechar But we can know and understand the scale of this atrocity.  We many not know how many tens or even hundreds of millions have died as a result of our drug policy, not just here at home but as exported around the world by virtue of our economic and military might, but we can know that it is in the tens or even hundreds of millions. newlinechar  newlinechar An atrocity without equal.

Naturally, you're right about snail mail. I forgot about that. But, it's a really slow way to interact with people.

That's a great point. It really depends on how much the religion affects the person. If the religion starts affecting every action and influencing their presidency to an extreme degree, I'd be against it. newlinechar  newlinechar Take Mitt Romney for example. If the prophet says something that's against what's in best interest of the nation, and Romney decides to follow the prophet because of his religion, than he is a fool. He might be a hell of a believer and good for him for following his religion so closely, but he is definitely not a great president if he puts the interests of his religion in front of the interests of the nation.

&gt; You cannot look at war as a popularity contest newlinechar  newlinechar You are refuting your own argument of a popular vote on the war. And I agree once again, when the media is pro war it is not hard to mobilize the masses. newlinechar  newlinechar You know how 1939 Poland was such a thread to Germany and how they attacked first in Gleiwitz? Every German knew the war was justified. Like Herrmann Goering said : 'Naturally the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. ...Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Each U.S. state has its own statute which dictates how much interest can be charged before it is considered usurious or unlawful. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If a lender charges above the lawful interest rate, a court will not allow the lender to sue to recover the debt because the interest rate was illegal anyway. In some states (such as New York) such loans are voided, meaning made void from the beginning or ab initio. Ref NY Gen Oblig 5-501 et seq. and NY 1503. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;However, there are separate rules applied to most banks. In 1980, due to inflation, national banks (banks that generally include N.A. in their name), federally chartered savings banks, installment plan sellers and chartered loan companies were exempted from state usury limits by the federal government through a special law.

just in case it's ripped: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar BRAND NEW Guitar Hero III Legends of Rock for the Nintendo Wii Game System newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar In Box Never Opened, just bought it a few days ago I will give you the receipt (shown in picture)! newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar Here’s the deal: newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar So I spent who knows how many hours of my life trying to get “Guitar Hero 3” for the Nintendo Wii for my 15 year old son who has been begging for it since he was born (well not really but he’s wanted it for awhile). So after waiting in lines and going into every game store in the city over the last 2 weeks (practically being laughed at when I asked for guitar hero 3) I finally got lucky and got one at EB Games (they just got a shipment of them 25 minutes before I walked in!). newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar So I was so relieved in that I had finally got the Holy Grail of Xmas presents pretty much just in the nick of time. I couldn’t wait to spread the jubilance to my son. newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar Then, yesterday, I came home from work early and what to I find? My innocent little boy smoking pot in the backyard with 2 of his delinquent friends. newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar Now I know santa applies the “naughty or nice” paradigm to determine who gets what on Christmas. My son (Isaac) hasn’t exactly been Mother Teresa this year (he got suspended for fighting in the spring, among other things) but I thought I could still justify getting him this present. Maybe it would make him stay home more and “rock out” on this fake guitar thing. He pretty much spends all his free time at his friend’s house playing it anyways (while high on marijuana, I would imagine). newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, I am now finding it hard to justify rewarding him with this gift after he so greatly disappointed me. I know smoking a joint isn’t the end of the world, but if you can convince me that he deserves the gift, then I will end the auction. You will have to be very convincing. I am an elementary school teacher and I know that rewarding bad behavior is just asking for more of the same… newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar After I caught him getting high on my patio I did the typical yelling, screaming, kicking out the friends, etc… but I had not decided on a suitable way to punish him. As of the time of me writing this, he does not know I got him Guitar Hero 3. I will show him the auction once it is posted and we can watch it finish together. Sort of a “Father-Son bonding experience”. While I doubt this will keep him from ever smoking pot again, I think it will make him think twice before doing illegal (well I think pot is still illegal in Canada) drugs on my property. newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar I am still considering getting him a game for his Nintendo. Maybe something like Barbie as the Island Princess or Dancing With the Stars. These games are in stock everywhere I go, and I know he will just love them. newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar Merry Xmas Isaac. I hope you’ve learned your lesson. –Father.

Not true.  Hong Kong speaks Cantonese, which is a regional dialect spoken in the surrounding provinces, reaching all the way to Taiwan.  It is such a popular dialect that when the Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, they had to make a conscientious decision to make Mandarin the official dialect because Cantonese was also a very popular dialect for the island. newlinechar  newlinechar And on the broader scale, most Chinese speak some dialects other than Mandarin; Mandarin is just the Beijing dialect that the Communist chose to standardize as the national dialect.  Most of their national figures speak Mandarin with an accent, if not a heavy accent.  Chairman Mao and Deng Xiaoping are two of those whose accents were very thick.  And in that context, people in Hong Kong also speak Mandarin, also with a heavy accent. newlinechar  newlinechar I know this because I spent 19 years in Hong Kong and various parts of China.

Penn's opinion of the films is only that, his opinion.  He didn't give a considered appraisal of their aesthetic value, just called films about hobbits shit.

Redditors like Penn's schtick more because his sentiments are closer to their own.  Penn generally goes after the low hanging fruit: bottled water is expensive and foolish (gee, really?), polling can be an instrument of propaganda(he figured this out in 2007?), gun control laws mostly work against those who respect the law (damn, next he'll discover that criminals are lawbreakers)... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong, we do live in times when the restatement of the obvious may be the first duty of intelligent men (Orwell), but Penn's rants take far too long to say far too little.

&gt; It already is that, like it or not. newlinechar  newlinechar Not so much in the FDA world.  There's a pretty rigorous process to get drugs qualified for sale in this country, and while there are some problems (vioxx), it's generally regarded that the FDA knows their stuff and things that the FDA says will treat a condition do so safely. newlinechar  newlinechar The difference between having an FDA and a 'free market' FDA is that the free market FDA would have to make a profit, meaning that not only does it have to cover its own costs, but has to provide its owners with cash, or else noone will want to do that.  The alternative is that the prices are so high that not everyone opts for such a process and their products are not necessarily safe, much like UL is today. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The reason you need this sort of 'consumer safety' has nothing to do with wanting to help people. newlinechar  newlinechar No, it has to do with the fact that I need to put my trust somewhere, and I'm not about to go all 'free market' when it comes to my health.  When my doctor prescribes something to cure my daughter's ear infection, I trust that he knows what he's doing and that what he prescribed went through as much testing as possible to make sure that it's not only safe, but also does the job it's supposed to do. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; That's why if a few dozen people die because of an e. coli outbreak, or a kitchen appliance explodes and kills 10 children, nothing substantial changes. newlinechar  newlinechar Aside from the FDA and CDC coming out with rules on how to properly handle and cook meat, you mean? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This is obvious to me, why isn't it obvious to you? newlinechar  newlinechar You live in some parallel utopia where all customers are smart and all companies put their customers ahead of a buck.

Why do you hate freedom and liberty?   newlinechar  newlinechar MSM, land lines, 'scientific' polls, blah blah etc etc.
That's the feeling I got from it too. There's been a few of these stories over the last few years and they always get huge attention, and thus good auction prices.
Especially in Saint Petersburg, which has no other skyscrapers -- by municipal ordinance, I believe -- and is dominated by gorgeous cathedrals, church spires and palaces.

For the $200 he paid for the game, he could realistically get a decent Yamaha.  You can't get a playable Fender for that money.

Maybe you *are* cool, but you only let it out when drunk. 
My reference was to the way many in America seem to dismiss things with the proposition 'Many socialists believe x, hence x is wrong'. All you have to do is shout communist and never mind an argument. newlinechar  newlinechar I actually don't know many self identifying socialists who dislike copyright law. Most just think it's too heavily slanted in favour of big business. Few consider it a simple matter of freedom. In the end, IP is an assault on free speech and that makes it totally immoral.
Was it really not the case? newlinechar  newlinechar Why can you not judge the man based on the research he conducts and how it fits with the questions he was asked to answer in the grant instead of firing him *before* based on assumptions about his beliefs? newlinechar  newlinechar He was fired *because of his beliefs* when he should have been allowed to do his research and judged on his output.
Better yet, if your local politician passes a bill then claims they didn't read it thoroughly, DON'T FUCKING VOTE FOR THEM AGAIN...
I don't dispute that compared to the world this is true, I just think that world politics don't have a say in America too much. There's a lot of people here who have never left there own state, let alone country. 
Well thanks for the discussion.  A few final points on my end, and I'll give you the last word: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Thank you for not resorting to personal attacks.  I get voted down, obviously, but you haven't been screaming bigot at me like so many others on this thread do, and I appreciate having a discussion with someone that actually listens to opposing points of view without labeling them first. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) I understand the argument that marriage is the *result* of a committed relationship, but I ask this question:  If an option to publicly label one's committed relationship is removed, will that not damage relationships because they have no way of taking that extra step?  In my mind, marriage is not a label, but an extra step.  If it weren't, than the piece of paper wouldn't mean anything and committed non-married couples would be the same as married couples statistically. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Nope. I also wouldn't give preference to couples over single parents. Everything should be handled on a case-by-case basis. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) There are obviously some situations where a single parent would be better than a couple of some sort.  Making same-sex marriage legal and on the same plane as opposite-sex marriage takes away the ability of adoption agencies to choose a married, opposite-sex couple over same-sex all things being equal, even given that scientifically a married opposite-sex couple is best *and* a child would have access to a mother *and* a father in one, and two of one (and therefor not getting the benefits of the inherent natural differences in the sexes) in the other. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;However, not having a parent of one particular sex doesn't rule out having role model of that sex. Aunts, uncles, family friends, etc. That is something that the case worker would take into consideration. newlinechar  newlinechar 4) Role models are great, and they are needed.  But that is not the same as a mother or father, and it never will be obviously. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I would never preclude someone from adopting based solely on their orientation, though. newlinechar  newlinechar 5) I never would either.  It has everything to do with selecting the best situation for a child that is presently available to the child. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks again for the post.  Hopefully some of the others on this thread can learn from you style of discussion and having a rational discourse.
Ordinarily I'd say 'not programming', but near the bottom of the first page is this quote: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Intensive-care medicine has become the art of managing  newlinechar &gt; extreme complexity—and a test of whether such  newlinechar &gt; complexity can, in fact, be humanly mastered. newlinechar  newlinechar This is the central problem of software, so I've put the rest of the 8-page article on the reading stack and voted it up.
So we suffer through 4-8 years of Hilliary and wait until things get so bad (changed from today's conditions) to get a majority vote. newlinechar  newlinechar That incredible thing will be that a vote for any other republican is a statement that things aren't so bad currently. Assuming that a republican like Guiliani wins, what does that say about our fellow citizens?
He certainly does not wander the streets eating brains.  These pictures are just more Atheist propaganda, designed to trick innocent children into rejecting God.
You should append, 'Many users are outraged that their *free* email service has been interrupted and are demanding their money back.'
&gt; There is a disconnect there. newlinechar  newlinechar Brainfart/typo. Read it as 'than'. Customers that don't die buy again. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; But the cost of getting it approved by a free-market company will be lower? newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, I would expect so. And unapproved drugs could still be available, as a last resort. newlinechar  newlinechar Really, is this so hard to believe? We laugh when 60 Minutes does an expose on $1000 hammers and accept it as a given, but then we talk about the FDA and it's an automatic assumption that they're giving us the best possible service for the lowest price? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Approved by whom? My contention is that the FDA is doing a perfectly fine job right now. newlinechar  newlinechar No, they're doing a barely adequate job, at best, and plenty would argue that they're not even doing that. They receive an incredible amount of criticism even from those wanting to keep it, and have done so for decades. newlinechar  newlinechar And it misses the point. Doctors are already approved to weed out the quacks, and are probably the largest piece in a better filter for these things. Coupled with a UL-like private testing firm, or even better with several, there's no real need for an FDA. 
&gt;But the whole point of my post was that the article couldn't be reduced to an ad hominem attack as you clearly claimed in the post I was replying to.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You're kidding, right?  I just reread your post.  You posted SEVEN paragraphs regurgitating the argument from the website, and then mentioned 'ad hominem' once, in a single sentence, right at the end. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If your purpose was actually addressing the ad hominem matter, you did a spectacularly poor job of it.  It sure seemed to me that you just wanted to repeat the website's arguments - and then looked around for some way to tie what you'd just written in to something I said. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But, it doesn't matter.  Clearly the tide is against me in this debate.  I think I shall leave it and go on to critique the poor representations of Quantum Physics to be found in Star Trek. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Ta ta.

&gt;The goal seems to be to bleed their followers of every bit of money they have, even at the cost of their own lives. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, Mormonism isn't about money at all.  This is why they stress tithing so much, and they're spending a billion dollars to buy a MALL in Salt Lake City. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In contrast, I KNOW many ex-Mormons who were 'allowed' to leave without any special fuss whatsoever. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I had to threaten them with the constitution of my country before they would take me off their membership lists.  I was shunned by former 'friends'.  It's a cult.
Very strange.  I was born in St. Petersburg and I always thought that the reason it didn't have any buildings over 10-20 stories was because the city is essentially BUILT ON A SWAMP. newlinechar  newlinechar That's also the reason why it has the deepest subway system in the world - every escalator is easily 100 meters long. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So a skyscraper? weird.  But maybe engineering has improved.
Look at that page I linked on bevets.com.  Evolutionists not only say that evolution is incompatible with Christianity, but they say it is incompatible with God, period. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you are going to believe in evolution, you need to be aware what exactly it is that you're believing in.
No, you are quite correct.  It's well documented that Battlestar Galactica has many references to the creator's Mormon faith.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Check these out: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.michaellorenzen.com/galactica.html newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.millennialstar.org/index.php/2006/02/12/ligbattlestar_galactical_ig_and_mormonis - this one is from a Mormon organization.

Are you a captain, Mr. Obvious?  Because it seems that your rank or credentials are more important than your evidence in determining credibility, at least according to this list. newlinechar  newlinechar It could also help if you're a psychologist or a lawyer, anyway.  I'm sure their expertise in the areas of structural engineering, metallurgy, aeronautics, materials science (etc., etc.) greatly qualify them to make judgments about the veracity of the official story.  Cause, you know, it *feels* wrong to them. newlinechar  newlinechar And the families!  Think of the families!  Their grief and sorrow at losing loved ones to the insane actions of religious nutbags obviously validates their hunches about a vast, multilayered government conspiracy, involving thousands of conspirators acting *completely* without notice, all overseen and run by a man who can't speak two sentences without looking like a retarded chimp.  And *no one* actually involved in the conspiracy has come forward.  Instead, we've got lawyers and shrinks making vague statements about there being 'more to the story'.  newlinechar  newlinechar Makes much more sense than that a few kooks obtained several large, powerful projectiles (i.e., jumbo jets) using security vulnerabilities, and used them to heavily damage several large buildings, the internal structure of which subsequently, due to the impact of thousands of pounds of hurtling metal and burning fuel (and falling parts of other buildings), was physically unable to remain standing and collapsed. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course.  It's so clear to me now.

Parents make stupid rules all the time - and some of those rules I'm willing to guarantee you also support. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Why exactly would you stop your 13 year old from having sex with his best friend, as long as they're using protection? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Why exactly should you stop your 10-year-old from smoking one or two cigarettes every day? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar A parent who is vegetarian for religious reasons, and grounds his 12-year-old for sneaking hamburgers on the sly is *also* 'stupid', right?  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Just let the most liberal common denominator of society (ie pop culture) raise your child. You have no responsibilities at all as a parent to make sure you teach your kids what's right and what's wrong *according to you*. Correct?
&gt;which also have common ancestry between them newlinechar  newlinechar A common fallacy.

It has everything to do with whether parents assess risks correctly. That's our job, that's what we're supposed to be doing FFS. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 'My house my rules' is all fine but no parent in their right mind should be so fucking rigid about it to the point of abandoning critical thinking and thus abdicating their responsibility.

&gt;there's good reason to be suspicious of the entire polygraph community. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The entire polygraph community, which encompasses thousands or tens of thousands of individuals.

The term 'false prophet' is an oxymoron.

First, I see you're also suffering of Google's bug with line spacing getting screwed up after a list. newlinechar  newlinechar I also want to correct you on two points: First, Microsoft has many cash cows, not just Windows and Office (somehow a very popular myth). Second, the reason this PC was so affordable wasn't the savings on software (OEM Windows is cheap, less than $50) but the crappy hardware. newlinechar  newlinechar I support your prediction that Linux will gain market share, but for a different reason: it simply has gotten better in recent years. For many, Firefox+Ubuntu will be *easier and more pleasant* to use than Vista+IE7, regardless of a price difference. newlinechar 
Basically, he moves the blocks by pivoting them on a small stone and using a lever to walk the block a little at a time.  The block is raised in a teeter-totter like fashion where a board is placed under the fulcrum, and then weight is added on one side creating a small gap under the fulcrum in which another board can be placed.  The weight is then transferred to the other end of the block and the process is repeated. 
We wouldn't be producing as much corn and the market would determine the best crop for each farm instead of the government.  It would also allow other nations like Mexico to compete on an equal basis.  The price of food may go up slightly but it would be cheaper for everyone as we wouldn't have to pay the subsidy and the place best suited to grow food would have the financial incentive to grow it.

I'd have to agree.  I'm rather surprised it came from someone in the catholic church though.

I've REALLY been impressed with Biden during all the debates.  His experience is second to none, and he is well-spoken, thoughtful, and humble.

Though they probably draw the same type of people to their campaigns.

Do non-Catholic Christians like Protestants or the para-Christian cults like Pentecostals have a form of Eucharist? How about confession?
A lot of us like guitar hero because it's a strong gateway drug to introduce our girlfriends to gaming. My girl went from GH3 to Time Crisis 4 to Uncharted.   newlinechar  newlinechar Further, I enjoy the game because I know I'm not going to learn guitar (I'd rather be learning Struts 2 or reading some book on Ajax or something); so I can rock out for a few hours when I'm in the mood.   newlinechar  newlinechar Personally - double worth it.

Yes, that's the first thing that came to mind in 2001 for me. I wonder why the security isn't applied there at the pilot's cabin, rather than at the customer turnstile. It seems far more possible to achieve security at this small place. To prevent hijacking of airplanes, you could use biometrics, or some other way to lock and secure that door. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, there should be designs in airplanes to account for the possibility that the worst will happen - the plane will fracture and a wing will fall off. This happens periodically, just because of a plane's age, and fragility. The original meaning of 'Murphy's law' says that you should account for these kinds of disasters happening - not hope that they just simply won't.
&gt;Belief has nothing to do with it. If a actress doesn't believe in showing her nude body on film then she is unqualified to do nude scenes. Does that mean she should sue the film company for not hiring her do nude scenes? After all they are discriminating against her for her beliefs. newlinechar  newlinechar This is not a fair analogy.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You can't offer spirtual guidance based on the bible if you don't believe in the bible and you cannot do evolutionary research if you discount evolution. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, you can.  I know at least one atheist pastor who is doing his job even though he doesn't believe himself.  He doesn't make that known to the congregation, but he does his job anyways. newlinechar  newlinechar He can speak on his research from an evolutionary perspective (he was willing to discuss it as a theory, see page 2), so he certainly could still do the research. newlinechar  newlinechar But he was fired *before* that based on the fact he didn't believe in Evolution. newlinechar  newlinechar That is clearly quoted here: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'My supervisor and I had a follow up meeting during which my supervisor informed me that *if I do not believe in evolution, then he was paying me for only 7 to 10 percent of the work* I was doing under the grant.' newlinechar  newlinechar [emphasis added]

I do think they can.  I think votes are decided on for a complex number of factors.  I mean let's be honest.  Ron Paul supporters are trying to influence the vote (why should seeing a blimp with a candidate's name on it make them more qualified? But that's the goal - to convince people who see it to vote for Ron Paul).  There are many influences in the world.  I'm not sure what your point is or how this is undemocratic.
Depends on where you ride your bike.
I don't think anyone is arguing that the Bible is archaeologically perfect while the Book of Mormon isn't.   newlinechar  newlinechar I think the issue for most people is that while the Bible presents at least a somewhat plausible story of history if you strip out the magic stuff (and your quotes even say many archaeologists felt that it had a kernel of truth in it), the story of the Book of Mormon is crazy on its face.  It's not plausible at all.  You don't even wonder whether it has a kernel of truth because anyone reading it can instantly see it doesn't.  Jews establishing an empire in South America?  Native Americans being their descendants?   newlinechar  newlinechar The best thing the 'established' religions have is their age.  They're so old that their claims are cloaked by time and so they can fall back on that uncertainty when the craziness is pointed out.  The problem young religions like Mormonism face is that their craziness is right out in the open because they haven't had thousands of years to obfuscate it.

&gt;Rainbow tables are brute force by definition, and can't be practically used to crack passwords of sufficient length and complexity, or even properly salted passwords. newlinechar  newlinechar Utter bullshit.  Rainbow tables run on a linear order.  O(n).  It's not a brute force attack; it's a dictionary attack.  The brute force method runs on O(n^x) where x is the length of your password, and n is the number of possible keys.  If you do the same thing with NP problems, then you must admit that P=NP, and your CS prof only told you differently so you would waste your time on things you won't figure out. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And you do realize that 'It may take you a long time, perhaps forever to write that equation or formula, but it would compute very quickly' is very nearly the definition of NP? newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, I do realize that.  But, if you do write it, and it computes very quickly, then P=NP.  So, again, I realize that I am correct. newlinechar  newlinechar The only reason that the millennium problems are not solved, if they truly are not solved, is because people are not working on them.  I wouldn't be surprised if some large corporations have solved them, and are not collecting the prize, because a monopoly on the knowledge is much more valuable.
If this is the case, then you should be especially careful. Maybe only 5% bother to submit, and if they stop, the only ones left submitting will be literal spammers. Whether they're dumb for taking it personal or not, discouraging them is a bad idea. newlinechar  newlinechar If I'm not mistaken though, people who submit stories that are downmodded lose karma, and subsequent submissions get an even lower placement. So excessive downmodding may keep even their new stuff buried, even if it has improved. Even if they're thick-skinned enough to not take it personally.
We can thank Clinton for starting the trend by perjuring himself. newlinechar  newlinechar THANK YOU BILL!!
It covers logic programming.  The first few chapters cover the basics of pure logic programming, which consists of establishing constraint relationships, and then evaluating the tree using a unification algorithm instead of the standard eval/apply loop.  Then the book gets more Prolog specific, but still general, detailing common algorithms, the plusses and minuses of depth first/breadth first unification and occurs checks, and analyzing complexity of logic programs. newlinechar  newlinechar I highly recommend the book, if only to get your mind around the unification based evaluation model, which is very useful for algorithms like typechecking or general graph traversal.

If the politics of the process won't allow him to win a nomination, he's not going to win as a 3rd party either. The futility of the efforts to fight the MSM have really become obvious to me over the past month. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem really is a lack of civic knowledge  by the population. There can be some very enlightened debate on reddit about the issues, but it really means zero outside the internet chat rooms. People still have no idea how government is supposed to work and they consider his ideas 'wacko'. newlinechar  newlinechar So in the end, its too hard to try and get his name out to the public, let alone educate them on the idea of checks and balances. The first primary will make or break the entire effort and listening to the Iowa citizens discuss politics is simply amazing.

Its amazing how much money other candidates will waste on having their 'entourage' follow them.

This is the first true American I've seen in a long time.
It's true that there are a good number of overzealous Ron Paul supporters.  However, can't that be said about any candidate?   newlinechar  newlinechar From my experience, a lot of Ron Paul supporters are extremely well informed.  Many others were not prior to learning about Paul, but are now making the effort to familiarize themselves with the issues and become informed. newlinechar  newlinechar This seems to me to be more common in the Ron Paul camp than in that of any other candidate.  For instance, have you ever heard a Thompson or Guiliani supporter give a solid reason on why they support their candidate?

The problem isn't defined by the solution.  You believe what you say so much, that you say the solution I've shown you is impossible, only because you know P!=NP.

Firsty, it is unavoidable that sometimes the result is outside of the margin of error. Even in the abstract 'ideal' case. 95% confidence means that it is espected that in 5% of the cases the result falls outside the bounds. With so many polls, your statement therefore is not true. Simple statistics. And reality is quite far removed from 'ideal'. newlinechar  newlinechar Second, saying something is quite different from doing it. The mindset is different. The context is different. There is always human interaction, so socially preferable choices come into play. All kinds of biases need to be filtered out, so you get a model that's used to 'process' the raw data, which is a hit-and-miss procedure. newlinechar  newlinechar All the attention that is going to the multitude of polls in the US, widely varying in quality and often distorted in the reporting, is wasted in my opinion. Better have meaningful discussion about real problems lying ahead. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm from Europe, and even the best available the polls I see here (Germany, France, UK, Holland) are not reliable.
&gt;Any poll that wants to be taken seriously will say it's sample size, sample methods and the exact questions asked. newlinechar  newlinechar And 99% of people will still have no idea whether the poll is trustworthy.

Not hugely useful, and actually it probably makes the code harder to understand, and it doesn't even really save any lines of code, but it's something you can do that might be handy under certain circumstances.

I disagree. I think if popular, underdog candidates form both parties teamed up, it would send a very powerful message. The libertarian party is as always already on all of the state ballots.

Convince them they can TKO the system that's been pissing them off and you'll get some votes.
I think what Rails really got right is that it took a bunch of 'good things', bound them up together, did it in a relatively disciplined way, and used a pleasant language.  That might not sound like much, but compared to some of the PHP spaghetti messes around, or the java/xml drudgeries elsewhere, it was a huge improvement. newlinechar  newlinechar These days, a lot of people are imitating it, so you could probably get something about as good in a language you already know.

Exactly.  And you have to recall that most of the founding fathers were Deists.  To them the 'Creator' was not very specific.

I would upmod it twice: once for RP and once for the parable. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you like that sort of story, perhaps this is another you will appreciate: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Once two monks on a pilgrimage came to the ford of a river.  There they saw a girl dressed in all her finery, obviously not knowing what to do since the river was high and she did not want to spoil her clothes.  Without more ado, one of the monks took her on his back, carried her across and put her down on dry ground on the other side. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Then the monks continued on their way. But the other monk after an hour started complaining, 'Surely it is not right to touch a woman; it is against the commandments to have close contact with women. How could you go against the rules for monks'  The monk who had carried the girl walked along silently, but finally he remarked, 'I set her down by the river an hour ago, why are you still carrying her?' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I know several stories like that and I find them to be applicable to life's situations over and over.

Transistor speeds depend on resistance and capacitance. Lower resistance and lower capacitance, increase the speed of a transistor. This somehow does one or both of these. newlinechar However, making these things at the current manufacturing rate is a different story. Also, faster transistors usually use more power and generate more heat. Designing a new transistor is probably one of the easier steps in getting this out into the market.

You can't generate 3 possibilities from 1 bit of information for simple combinatorial reasons: there can be no surjective map from a set of size 2^1 = 2 to a set of size 3. So at least one element will be left out, and probabilistically speaking that means its chance of being picked will be 0, which rules out a uniform distribution. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; i don't think your expected number of bits is quite right, i think you need to drop the 2^, since i defined n being the number. newlinechar  newlinechar Doh, you're right.

This is a surprise?  [Concurrency](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=threadring&amp;lang=all)  aside, I find it common to write Haskell code that is as fast as C.  It is true that for most things, the C can be tweaked to go a bit faster, but that tweaking needs to be done on a case-by-case basis.  In Haskell, it is easier to compose optimized components.  Better algorithms beat an optimized compiler any day and using the best algorithms everywhere in C code tends to be painful, error-prone, and usually disparaged as premature optimization.  However, once we find the hot-spots in C, improving the algorithm can involve significant refactoring. newlinechar  newlinechar To pick the first example from the article, the C code, built with gcc -O3 takes 1.8 seconds for my 40 MiB file.  The naive Haskell code takes 11 seconds with ghc -O2.  Not so good, but it is easy to use bytestrings: newlinechar  newlinechar     import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as C newlinechar     main = print . length . C.words =&lt;&lt; C.getContents newlinechar  newlinechar This takes 2.2 seconds.  Not bad, but length.words isn't fusing.  Until the compiler does this, we need to do a little extra work to beat C. newlinechar  newlinechar     import qualified Data.ByteString as S newlinechar     import Data.ByteString.Internal (isSpaceWord8) newlinechar  newlinechar     wcount :: S.ByteString -&gt; Int newlinechar     wcount s = wc 0 s newlinechar         where wc !n s | S.null s = n newlinechar                       | (isSpaceWord8 (S.head s)) = wc (n+1) (S.dropWhile isSpaceWord8 s') newlinechar                       | True = wc n s' newlinechar                   where s' = S.tail s newlinechar  newlinechar     main = print . wcount =&lt;&lt; S.getContents newlinechar  newlinechar And this runs in 0.68 seconds, more than twice as fast as the C code!  (Better buffering in the C code ought to match or beat this, at the cost of added complexity.)

So are you asking why python doesn't ask you to be more like C or Pascal syntaxes where you have to say 'int i'? I'm not really sure, but would guess it has to do with less typing and the move by recent scripting languages to keep down the amount of boilerplate code you need to type. newlinechar  newlinechar It took me a while to adjust to when I first moved to python but you get used to it (mostly because I used to use declarations as a mechanism for understanding the composition of classes in java, but don't really think along those lines now). newlinechar  newlinechar I agree on you suggestion that you can mistype a variable in python as a result in some scenarios, but not as many as you might think. For example - you can't just randomly insert variables in python and have it work. newlinechar  newlinechar For example: a=a+1 wouldn't work if 'a' hadn't been previously defined. Equally, you couldn't say call_fn(a) if 'a' hadn't been defined. But you're right - you could mistype when setting a variable and accidentally create a second variable when you meant to rebind another. newlinechar  newlinechar     a = 5 newlinechar     print 'hello' newlinechar     as = 6 # whoops - I hit the 's' key accidentally. newlinechar  newlinechar I think I've only made this mistake once in the last year or so, and it was picked up quickly enough during debugging.

I've been to a subway dance party, but I'm fairly certain there was no sex.  Just train after train of hundreds of silly hippies doing their thing.  Oh, and a few passengers.   newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Hmm, this is being modded down.  Seemingly, the topic of the original post was the (rather unlikely) notion of subway sex parties, expressed as a curiosity.  My presumption was that informing on the very real existence of no-permit, large-scale subway parties as a form of hippie urban adventurism would constitute relevant information.  Was this some form of factual information the dissemination of which is discouraged on Reddit?

Because the mother is a concious person, alive and interacting with the world.

Unfortunately this point, as far as I'm aware, is still debatable.
I think you've misjudged RP.  From everything I've heard him say he advocates a tempered, long-term dismantling of the _Federal_ government, but he's not even the hard core free marketer that everyone makes him out to be.  He continuously advocates building more veterans hospitals, supporting those who are dependent on government assistance, and States' rights.  That last point is particularly poignant because, if any or all of the states should decide to allow universal health care, free abortions for all, and a 99% tax rate, then RP would not interfere. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think his most radical policies are those on foreign policy and balanced budgets, which is where I believe he draws most of his support from.

It helps not to be so pedantic when reading, otherwise you fly right past the point. newlinechar  newlinechar Just assume that the tires have no air in them.

If you do it right, you gradually alter your data in such a way that it's impossible to disentangle the useful information from the garbage. newlinechar  newlinechar But, as you said, it's a lot of trouble to go to.

There is always friction between different ethnic groups, that is partly why we have distinct ethnic groups, because they tend not to mix.

A short answer: newlinechar  newlinechar * Why the attack not applicable to other types of hashes: because they haven't figured out how to do it efficiently yet. Someday they may, at which point it is time to move on again. newlinechar * Because there are many legitimate uses for random &amp; random-looking data, is impossible to tell whether a package is legitimate or not. Both legitimate and evil packages can very well have perfectly functional (e.g. as a public key) random data in the same place. No amount of diligence can tell you that it was carefully chosen for an MD5 collision or not. newlinechar * Finally, you are requiring the vulnerable party to have near-oracular attention to detail, a level of detail that I certainly don't trust myself to have. There are enough hiding places in your average data format as to make finding it a Sisyphean task. Security is hard enough as it is, thanks. newlinechar * As a final note, respecting an end-of-file character isn't necessarily a bug; it's by design. That's why there is a special character denoted EOF.

Likewise the isspace caching--you probably realize that isspace() is almost certainly using its own compile-time-defined lookup table, so a compiler that allowed inlining of standard library functions would make your caching redundant. I know that these things _are_ useful with most C compilers, but that's ridiculous and somewhat sad, and it's partially the language's fault. Doing your own IO buffering can be called for when you're doing something fancy, but this case (linear reads) is something that shouldn't require any special work to run at maximum speed out of the box. What's nice about C is that you can do all these things yourself when you have to, but it shouldn't be necessary as often as it is.

As has already been pointed out to you in that original discussion, the things talked about in the 'We the People Act' relate specifically to issues of morality.

&gt;Ron Paul’s politics may be all but indistinguishable from Pat Buchanan’s, but his very demeanor, his feeble minded face, bleating voice and weak eyes make him seem non-threatening.

&gt;...and Chomsky thinks a better candidate would be...? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm taking issue with your choice of word 'candidate.' The question of how to do things better is obviously an open debate, and chomsky has his opinions on that too (though not on this article). But it's not as though thoughtful historical analysis is without value. If you think that just throwing a Ron Paul or a Dennis Kucinich (or even a Ralph Nader) into the president's chair is going to fix everything then you're totally missing the point of his work. He does advocate a number of concrete ideas (universalism of morality, consensus building, opportunity implies responsibility, etc.), but just because he doesn't end it with a 'and that's why you should support XY next election!' doesn't make it 'not constructive.'

I think that this change makes sense. The country will now be four-and-a-half hours behind UTC, equivalent to mean solar time at a longitude of 67°30' W (15°·4.5=67°30'). The largest city in Venezuela, Caracas, is at 66°58' W, so most of the population will now be close to mean solar time. Before, it was at four hours behind UTC, corresponding to 60° W, a meridian that runs east of the country.

I just read the specification for the AMQP protocol.. pardon me but it seems a heck of a lot easier to follow than XMPP. newlinechar  newlinechar Going to xmpp.org and finding this didn't help with my confidence for XMPP: http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course the core RFCs are here: http://www.xmpp.org/rfcs/ newlinechar  newlinechar Isn't as functional for a message queuing operation as AMQP after the first XMPP Core RFC (3920)! It requires at least twice the documentation if not more (given that it is relying on other layers of standards including XML). Maybe they are just unbelievable thorough but I would have to say there is a lot of extraneous worrying in the Core RFC that wouldn't apply to a lot of AMQP type deployments. newlinechar  newlinechar Then we get a claim that AMQP is probably never going to be deployed outside of the financial industry. That might be true but it is a riddled way of saying that AMQP is designed to work well in the environments it is used in. Maybe there are other industries that might share the same needs maybe not... but I find that whole claim a little too prophetic to be coming from someone who isn't involved in AMQP. newlinechar  newlinechar I did upvote the article as I think it raises general awareness of some useful technology standards that really ought to have a little more mind share. I will warn that I don't agree with the author very much on the same token. What does that mean for me? I'll probably use AMQP for message operations that fit it and XMPP for cases that might need the extra P or  any of its extensions. I'm also not against home-brewed protocols if used in the right contexts. newlinechar

Even 'random' data in the form of a public key can be verified: have them sign a message with the corresponding private key. In general, though, I agree that it is unreasonable for a sufficiently complex message for any signer to make any absolute guarantees about its legitimacy or safety, but that is what they purport to do. newlinechar  newlinechar It seems that according to the definition for a cryptographic algorithm given [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual/html_node/Digital-signatures.html), MD5 is indeed broken due to the collision resistance requirement. But only when the same source generates both &lt;x&gt; and &lt;x'&gt;, not in general. I'm not opposed to using stronger hashes than MD5, I just want people to understand what is possible and what isn't. newlinechar  newlinechar This collision resistance requirement comes about because the signer is allowed leniency in authenticating a message. They are not required to verify its efficiency, to ensure that the message is complete and that every part of it is integral, that nothing extra is added. Perhaps this is a practical concession in the real world, but it really seems like a cop-out to me. When reading the election prediction paper, you get to the point where they explain the message is in the form of a PDF with embedded data and it's immediately obvious that this would put the message's legitimacy in question. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, the weakness opened up in MD5 is that a single source may be able to produce multiple messages with the same hash. But the only valid use of this hash is to verify that the message you received matches the one your source intends to distribute. The fact that the same source can now generate multiple (likely somewhat questionable) messages with the same hash doesn't change this, although it gets a bit more complicated when intermediaries like the console companies are involved. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, respecting an EOF character and aborting when you're supposed to be signing the entire message is a bug, an implementation error, plain and simple.
The original poster is a little confused about the nature of open source. The only seriously useful thing a huge anonymous crowd can contribute to an open source project are well formed bug reports, and to a much smaller degree feature suggestions.

It was a great campaign, the most incredible multi-racial, electoral insurgency this nation has ever seen. It changed the Democratic Party, and changed America. Why was I for Jackson?

Absolutely.  I grew up in NYC and one of my high school english teachers spent an afternoon telling us how different the rest of the US was.  For one thing, she said kids who grow up in NYC tend to assume that the US population is roughly half black, but that outside of very large cities, the US was overwhelmingly white, and that most NYC kids had trouble believing it until they saw it.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar She was right; none of us exactly thought she was lying, but we were all baffled by the possibility that the racial makeup of the rest of the country could be so different from what we'd grown up seeing.

It is distinctly evident, wjw75, that you don't know these people.  'Special interest' libertarians are common enough, who won't give but will happily take from you -- the bastards who gave us modern 'free trade', in which everyone is free to sell us what we tell them to sell us at the price we name. newlinechar  newlinechar For my part, I want to leave other people alone.  I'll bear as much burden as I know how, but I look at this country around me (and this world around it) and I can't help but wonder what really caused the problems I see. newlinechar  newlinechar How many of our problems are caused by our foreign policy?  By our fear-mongering, here and worldwide?  By our installation of despots?  Let's trade broadly, but let's not be in the trade of establishing dictators: and let's ship our billions and trillions overseas as goods, not bombs. newlinechar  newlinechar How many of our problems are caused by locking up harmless men and women?  By destroying families, by tearing apart communities?  By establishing gender imbalances in society so women in the victimized subgroups have to take the men they can get, or be alone -- giving priggish, infantile men the chance to abuse and objectify them, to use them and never have to grow up?  Let's get back to liberty, stop locking so many people up, and end the drug war. newlinechar  newlinechar Government can work, but it can't work on the basis we have right now.  We need a foundation.  I don't like what Paul wants to do socially, but I flatly do not care.  I want law restored.  I want liberty restored.

But there are many factors that could have caused that to happen. newlinechar  newlinechar One of the trickiest things about shareware is finding a balance for incentive to pay. If your app feels 'disabled' until registered, people will often simply give up on it. But if your users don't gain anything by paying you, most simply won't. A related issue is figuring out how much to charge. newlinechar  newlinechar Examples of failed business plans can be found for any sales model in any industry, but it doesn't follow that those models or industries are necessarily unprofitable. newlinechar  newlinechar I am a Mac developer, and I know that on that platform there are a number of successful shareware companies, like [Panic](http://panic.com/) and [Delicious Monster](http://www.delicious-monster.com/) off the top of my head. According to wikipedia Delicious Monster's shareware program [Delicious Library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_Library) made about $250,000 in the first month after its release. I don't know how many downloads they've had, but the total number of users of Mac OS X is estimated around 20 million, so Delicious Library has clearly had fewer downloads than the FTP program you mentioned. newlinechar  newlinechar It is possible that shareware is a more viable model on the Mac than it is on other platforms, but somehow I doubt it. I think it's more a matter of figuring out the economics of the situation so that users have enough reason to compensate you for your work.

Technically, she also raped 6 of them (the ones under 16).   newlinechar  newlinechar The way the legal system is set up (in the US, AU might be different), two under-16's having sex are mutually raping each other.  I mean if an under 16 girl can't understand the choices about sex, the same applies to the male.  What I'm getting at is that under law, none of the under-16s consented, therefore each guy would get one count of statuatory rape, and she'd get 6. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe.

You're dead right. I work all day in a slightly odd offshoot of Java, where it's embedded - and here the whole primitives/objects debate takes exactly the opposite line to that Web-heads take. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason Java is confusing, and the reason it's brilliant at the same time, is it works in both domains. To do so there is a trade off, and the auto-boxing stuff described is dead right. I literally do write Java 1.4, since generics and auto-boxing have been such a mess (and the embedded systems don't like them either!) newlinechar  newlinechar Java is a great idea, but they need to rethink and reimplement it from the ground up, or at least have the balls to throw massive parts of it away. (Vectors! - kill them now). The problem is there's such a spread of people using it they'll never create one language that pleases all, so there will always be 'Java sucks' posts on the net.

*if*. ACL only supports class sealing in some restricted cases. SBCL does so a bit. But, even then, if you don't have generic function sealing too, it's far from being as efficient as struct accessors. Even if you can very efficiently get to the right slot, you can't inline the right method body directly. Moreover, due to change-class (not class redefinition), you usually have to go through an additional level of indirection than structs.

A wikipedia search for 'sociopath' redirects to 'psychopathy.'  There appear to be minor differences: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;David T.

This is what was reported in the Catholic press: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Given the publicity about priests who have abused young males, it is understandable that some may be led to assume that a homosexual orientation is more likely to be associated with sexual abuse of a child. But this is an assumption that needs to be challenged. Pedophilia is distinguished by the fact that a person is attracted to a child as an object of sexual desire. It is the age of the child, not the child’s gender, that specifies the disorder. Often pedophiles will abuse children of both genders. Thus, sexual orientation as commonly understood is secondary to the dominance of a disordered attraction to prepubescent children. Pedophiles who are attracted to boys and those who are attracted to girls have more in common with each other than they do with homosexuals and heterosexuals generally. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;A somewhat different pattern is evident when the child is an adolescent and postpubescent. An adult’s sexual attraction to an adolescent, referred to as ephebophilia, shows a more decided preference for one gender over the other and, in this limited sense, parallels sexual orientation.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar https://americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=1673

I was under the impression that accessors for classes should be just as efficient as for a struct since they can maintain a pointer to the slot in the slot vector. Sure they need to be redefined whenever the cpl changes, but that is what the MOP is for. newlinechar  newlinechar Ok so you can't inline the accessor and that sucks, but is the performance drop *that* much? Something like that is a microptimization, and I suspect that it doesn't matter except in a *very* small number of cases (large system on small hardware?), and then sure you can use the uncleanliness of structs to get that half a percent more performance.

I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, and I can tell you it is meaningless crap.  Politics and gamesmanship.  Even in engineering.  There's really nothing on earth as worthless as a college degree.  Education is very worthwhile, but you'll get that or you won't, regardless of whether you are in college, and regardless of whether you graduate with a 4.0 or flunk out.  There are some correlations between things like credentials and ability, but they are too tenuous to be useful in hiring, I've found.  The only exception is:  A PhD from a top-notch institution is a pretty good marker of competence.  It also costs beaucoup de bucks, to me as an employer, and I can do better elsewhere by using judgement and discernment instead of relying on paper.

That's one of the reasons that all your anecdotal evidence is just not that helpful. While it's undoubtedly true that some perpetrators abuse girls more than boys or vice versa *especially when the children are older*, it's by no means a truism. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In many families, the dynamic is such that only the girls end up coming forward or legal action is pursued only for cases involving girls.

Seems you are unaware that sperm donation is anonymous, and the donor has NO CONTACT with or indeed knowledge of specifically who they may fertilize.  The responsibility is transferred absolutely.  This is the way the arrangement is defined and licensed by the state, it seems, for good reason, making it utterly different from the sorry example in the news story, where all 3 adults are grossly at fault. newlinechar  newlinechar In the original example, the child's rights are not protected.  That's why I describe it as being bargained away so the parents can go after what they personally want without placing the interests of the child first.

Actually, Shareware is much more profitable on a mac.

I kid you not sir. This happened late '05, no parental permission was ever given, except the paper all parents sign in the beginning of the year basically giving the school permission to do anything they want. I was in one of the classes escorted down to the area in the gym, we had to keep quiet and walk with our hands on our head, when I refused to keep my hands up they threated me, and I am ashamed to admit that after four guys with M4s told me to do it I listened. A couple other students were less compliant and were arrested. Along with a few other kids who were unlucky enough to have a little weed on them when they brought the dogs in. All this was dubbed a 'lockdown drill' for our protection.

While he has stated he is personally against abortion he thinks the federal government should have no say in the matter.  It's too personal it should be decided at the local level, he is for this, not a flat out decision to ban abortion.

Neither your favored situation nor mine would work here because nearly everyone already has a gun, and those who seek to disavow them are targeted for that very decision. The only solution I see in this situation is an uprising from within. A firm resolution from the members of the community to reverse their lot.

Americans don't have any respect for life. They're so dumb they think supporting the troops means sending them to wars based on lies. 1 million Iraqis dead for lies, and Americans don't even bat an eye. For Americans to respect their own children, well, that's asking too much. Better to murder and kill them in the name of 'women's rights'.

Merely 10 would be a luxury. One doctor's surgery I used to visit in North London routinely had more than 60 people waiting for appointments with three doctors first thing in the morning, almost all of them Turkish immigrants apparently straight off the plane. Another in West London would commonly have 30 to 40 people waiting to see two doctors. By the time you got to see the doctor yourself they were usually so harrased and overworked they could barely give you 3 minutes before hustling you out the door, maybe with a referral to a clinic sometime in the coming six months. Anyone who can afford it in the UK goes to private doctors.

The figure I heard is 15%. Four separate studies involving non-self-selected samples  in the 50's, 60's, 70's, and 80's independently found 15% of babies were provably not the progeny of their legal father (via blood testing, not DNA). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm googling for references and finding no joy... but...

Look at the infrastructures that DO exist, I mean.  If you go with a shareware company, they gut you and take 60%+ of your sales.  A ridiculous amount when they should be getting, at MOST, a 10% finder's fee for hooking up a seller and a buyer. newlinechar  newlinechar Or look at, say, the online game distribution plans.  Xbox Live from Microsoft makes sure that every game developed for their service is vetted through their 'portfolio management' group of nazis.  Sony has similar plans for PSN and exorbitant prices to even start developing for their platform.  Nintendo just ignores anyone who isn't Japanese.  Steam on the PC side takes massive chunks of revenue and has a high bar of entry as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The companies that currently provide, or are providing in the next few years, an online distribution infrastructure that could enable such a market if they would simply ALLOW it, are crippling their services.  They know this is going to cost them money.  They have seen YouTube.  They have seen all of the online ventures that only benefit from openness, and yet they still close off their systems.  Also, if you talk to anyone involved in the game development business you quickly learn that it is a very insular and hierarchical group with elevated aristocrats lording over a sea of peons expected to work 100 hour weeks for months on end to crank out another movie licensed megabudget hunk of turd for an uberpublisher.  For small game companies the goal is to be cannibalized by one of the uberpublishers.  No one can really speak up because it is so easy to get 'black balled' if you don't 'play the game'.  And don't get me started on how far the dying retail market will go to put the stop to any of these online distribution models.
Glad to hear it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Richardson has a lot to offer.  I find it frankly baffling that he doesn't get more attention, especially with him being one of the only governors running. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think the big 'problem' with him is that he's a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and our country is currently so ideologically divided that they can't get behind someone who's focused on results without subscribing to one 'side' or another.  (which is a real shame since I think a lot of his success in turning New Mexico around comes from his ability to blend progressive 'leftist' spending with common-sense 'rightist' government cutting.)

The legislation he has sponsored is directly in line with what the Constitution says.  Yes, it will be tough to fix this country and yes some of the things he does seem harsh on the surface but if you look a little deeper you will see the overall benefit of freedom from big government and taxes FAR outweighs the temporary sacrifice.  Also many of the things he votes against are much better handled at the state and local level.  That was the way this country was meant to be.  Ex.

Ron Paul makes it clear in his position that he understands that the government has promised people social security, and he understands that the government has 'trained' people to be co-dependent on the system and so he won't just cut it off immediately, but instead phase it out and make sure people have lots of options to opt out.  Also, what he will do is get rid of the social security taxes which he and everyone else understands is a fraud anyhow.  Plus, unlike all the other candidates, he has a way of funding the 50 trillion dollar social security/medicare obligations without ruining the value of the currency.

I have no suggestion for these particular people as they are pretty much stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Paul advocates reducing the size and scope of the government not because it's full of incompetent power brokers whose allegiances are to themselves and their corporate sponsors rather than the American people, but rather, he advocates it because: newlinechar  newlinechar A) It's inherently oppressive to force the people to pay for government programs and, being a 'necessary evil,' should be minimized as much as humanly possible. newlinechar  newlinechar B) He believes the for-profit marketplace can provide most goods and services cheaper and better than the not-for-profit government can, and at least empirically it's tough to argue against that.

There are definitely some nice aspects to a good job as compared to your own business. For example, on average, the stress and hours are a lot less if you're not running your own business.

One can conclude that pedophilia is *often* a separate preference from hetero- or homo-sexuality, but one cannot conclude that 'most male pedophiles -- even those whom prefer boys -- are heterosexual.'   newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, one study (Erickson, 1988) claims that 'Eighty-six percent of offenders against males described themselves as homosexual or bisexual,' but this study is dismissed by the  author of the page because it fails to differentiate between gay and bisexual offenders.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another study (Marshall et al. 1988) found that 14 of 21 offenders against male children were more aroused by female adults and 7 were more aroused by males.

Yes, what benjamincanfly said.  Greenpeace foster a rather aggressive approach to conservation, which I sort of find repulsive.

Money opens up tons of educational and research opportunities. It's not as though it's going to some giant pot somewhere to ferment. And even then, the endowment acts as a great source for university development.  newlinechar  newlinechar In my three and a half years at my college so far, we've added a new library, renovated the old one, added a new dorm, giant art museum, added an Islamic Studies Center, built among the largest interdisciplinary research buildings in the world, doubled the size of the public policy school, created a giant new student plaza, and even built one of the first bleeding-edge, high-tech sustainable homes for students, designed by kids in the engineering school. And that's since 2004, and my school's endowment isn't as big as the top Ivy's. And, our football program sucks epically.

The trust fund covers a tiny percentage of the total current obligation, and as you suggest politicians left and right have been happy to go ahead and spend it on other things.  So I basically don't consider these savings in my analysis. newlinechar  newlinechar The fundamental problem as I see it is that social security has very little to do with savings, and a whole lot to do with redistribution, from the current working to the current retired.  As such, more retirees per worker, for the reasons described above, mean more burden for current workers. newlinechar  newlinechar Alternatively, savings-based approaches always maintain parity between the working and the retired, because they are the same person at different times, and the amount saved need be much less due to expected growth of in the market from technological advances and such. newlinechar  newlinechar If you're concerned about inequity, there's room here for subsidizing the poor's retirement accounts, which would require a much smaller role in the economy to achieve the same effects. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm guessing the only reason the more sound approach wasn't taken was that it didn't provide the political benefits to Roosevelt, as it would have been decades before people would need to start drawing out funds.

Lower income people must spend a higher percentage of their income for basic necessities. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the highest taxing percentages on wages are reserved for the wealthiest.  There is essentially a purely flat tax on capital gains, but that flat rate is below the rate on most wages.  Thus, the wealthiest pay low income taxes because much of their income is from capital gains, not from wages.   newlinechar  newlinechar The problem is that if you raise capital gains tax, you reduce the benefit for people to invest in businesses that provide the goods and services we all use. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a catch-22, and if anyone tells you there's a simple solution, they're full of crap.

Thanks for the kind comment! Well, I'm not too sure about the price. Pricing is so much harder than coding that it's sick. newlinechar  newlinechar I described the pricing history in the comment above. I've always received about the same number of complaints about the price (few), and sales have grown more or less steadily. Many sales are from companies too. newlinechar  newlinechar Even if I'm totally positive that programmers don't like buying software tools, I nowadays tend to think that I'd be doing better at $99. I think we programmers err on the side of selling too cheap more often than  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also quite liberal with sending out discounts. Part of the thinking is that if the actual, real, only problem is the price, the person will at least drop me a line (some people do). Interested fellow redditors, feel free to drop me a line and I'll give you a nice discount. newlinechar  newlinechar Except for the support issues (which are a big burden for a one-man-band), I'd love to sell 4x as much at $29 - but I think it just wouldn't happen. I think most of the price sensitivity comes in the gap from $0 to $10, the jump from $10 to $79 only accounts for a few extra lost users.

A `Seq` of `Choice` of empty-accepting expressions will make it go exponential, iterating over tons of equal expressions for each letter. That issue would probably become obvious when one would do the obvious thing and prune `Phi` continuations (states) away from the choices. Merging equivalent states is only slightly more complex than pruning `Phi`s. For example, one could do hash-consing and use a hash table of states that already are in the toplevel `Choice` (or transitively so) expression.

The problem these days in Western nations, is the trend that governments wish to put people in prison **before** they commit crimes. The ethic in previous decades was that people had to commit a crime, before they would go to prison. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The oligarchy of the soviet union was a government which we on the other side of the globe deplored for several reasons - but one reason, was this same authoritarian practice.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar When a person is imprisoned because of supposed inclinations she or he has... it's the death knells for a free society. The thing is, that governing officials get big heads about how much influence they really have on their society. They think that the police keep order in a society; where in fact, the police are very small part of a very complex social process whereby order is kept in a society. Those who ignore the real ways in which our society maintains peace among neighbors, will act in ways which undermine this process. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This woman's imprisonment is an example of government *undermining* the process whereby peace is kept in the streets of our towns and cities. Does that sound backwards?  Let me explain. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Well, how do towns and cities keep the peace? The police have never been able to be everywhere, or see everything. That's absurd. What happens is that people who see a crime happening, can use their best judgement as to what is best for the situation. If they think that it's best to talk to the person or ignore it altogether, they can do that. If they believe it's best to notify someone in authority in the situation - a boss, or professor, or manager... they can do that. If they want to go directly to the police, they can do that, as well. But the locus of control, is in society's own hands. We, as citizens, are the ones who choose to hold ourselves and others to social standards. And laws are *our* tool with which to do that. Authoritarians in positions of government should not think to usurp that role, just because of a change in society with the internet - where ideas and information are so freely shared and passed around. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now for our current system to work properly, we have to be more friendly. They need to engage their neighbors in conversation on the train, and bus, and on the sidewalk. People in the cities of the usa think it is respectful to ignore their neighbors. That's just cold. That's not respect. If people want to live in unique ways - go out and get a house somewhere out in the rural countryside; it's cheap. If you're in the city, you have to appreciate diversity - but you also have to talk to one another - and be a community. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Thankfully, we have libertarianism rising as an influence in our society. This is a good trend... where people have realized that they don't need authoritarians around. newlinechar  newlinechar

Look at it this way.  The Boy Scouts get public money often in the form of discounts at state parks, etc.  This means that they are publicly funded.

The Boy Scouts as a whole are publicly funded, therefore everything they do should be subject to the same rules. newlinechar  newlinechar To take it back to the university... yes, you can say that so-and-so amount of money was used for this or that.

How do you define 'big'?  Ada is a general-purpose fully object-oriented programming language, ala C++ or Java.  A few years ago I read comparisons of Ada with other language in terms of keyword count and other naive measures of programming language complexity, but can't seem to locate any of them now.

The 'semi-barbaric King' of an ancient land utilized an unusual form of administering justice for offenders in his kingdom. The offender would be placed in an arena where his only way out would be to go through one of two doors. Behind one door was a beautiful woman hand-picked by the king and behind the other was a ravenous tiger. The offender was then asked to pick one of the doors. If he picked the door with the woman behind it, then he was declared innocent and as a reward he was required to marry the woman, regardless of previous marital status. If he picked the door with the tiger behind it, though, then he was deemed guilty and the tiger would rip him to pieces. newlinechar  newlinechar One day the king found that his daughter, the princess, had taken a lover far beneath her station. The king could not allow this and so he threw the suitor in prison and set a date for his trial in the arena. On the day of his trial the suitor looked to the princess for some indication of which door to pick. The princess, did, in fact, know which door concealed the woman and which one the tiger, but was faced with a conundrum. If she indicated the door with the tiger, then the man she loved would be killed on the spot; however, if she indicated the door with the lady, her lover would be forced to marry another woman and even though he would be alive she would never be with him again. Finally she does indicate a door, which the suitor then opens. newlinechar  newlinechar Did the tiger come out of that door, or did the lady?

The compiler is faster at catching problems with types than a suite of unit-tests are. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Not that Java is particularly hot at either. It doesn't allow you to change code during execution, and the type system is anemic.
you're mistaken with biodiesel - the implications for conservation when land is devoted to *growing fuel* will cause untold hunger as land that should be used to feed hungry poor people is instead co-opted to keep fat rich fuckers on the road in their unbelievably inefficient SUVs. The big problem with biodiesel is that it allows the same infrastructure of liquid fuel, which is highly attractive to the liquid fuel purveyors currently selling fossil fuels. It's a distraction from a move to purely electric cars, which would cut the current liquid fuel companies completely out of the loop. biodiesel is less green than petrol burning in a modern clean engine, as there is still a huge energy overhead fertilising, growing, moving it all and refining the fuel, as opposed to just pumping it out of the ground. The return on energy investment is way too small. newlinechar  newlinechar Biodiesel's only possible hope is biodiesel from algae, which is hundreds of times more efficient per square km than any land based source, but still, electrics with maybe extra power units (such as a biodiesl generator) that could be plugged in specifically for long journeys would be my proposed solution, when I get round to saving the world....

How much do you want to bet that that woman who wrote harry potter is universally more well known that old Arthur C., though he is a better, more respected author?  Being respected doesn't mean shit.  He's underrated because he's unknown and sci-fi is a pretty commonly overlooked genre of fiction, outside of people like reddit users (myself included).  Ask the average moron walking down the street if they read sci-fi and they'll scoff at you, but then pleasantly tell you about the latest harry potter book where he gets his sister off with his magic wand.  Arthur C. Clarke is known to you, me and Dupree, but no one else gives a shit about him.

&gt;Ada always came off favorably in these measures, which were undertaken mostly to counter the popular misconception that Ada was a complicated, unwieldy language. newlinechar  newlinechar That's the impression I was under. I think this is due to the formality of the spec. I'm looking at it now and it says, newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The process by which a construct achieves its run-time effect is called *execution*. This process is also called *elaboration* for declarations and  *evaluation* for expressions. One of the terms execution, elaboration, or evaluation is defined by this International Standard for each construct that has a run-time effect.' newlinechar  newlinechar Sounds too formal for typical programmers I think. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Informally speaking, as one well-versed in the language, the specs and the language itself are well-designed, consistently defined, and with very few 'gotchas' that programmers have to be mindful of. newlinechar  newlinechar Excellent, I may have to take a look at Ada...any recommendations for compilers?
I see what you did there, but it kinda fell flat. I award you a third of an upmod for the effort.
Okay, we are talking about different things here.  Yes they may profit on football and it pays for the other sports.  But what I'm saying is they should get rid of all the sports entirely, as they do lose money on sports overall.   newlinechar  newlinechar Students are paying for an education, if they want to play or watch sports that should be a private, separate enterprise.  Not doing so is very unfair to the students who don't care about sports but are forced to fund it, and it is also unfair to our society, brainwashing people to think sports are important instead of intellectual things.
If they claim that they are whaling solely for scientific reasons you can demand that no commercial gains should be drawn from it and somebody should verify this.  newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, I can't believe that such a rich country like Japan needs some whaling to enhance its GNP. The people involved could be easily paid by their Govt for their losses and be trained in some other job. There are poor countries who don't do such stuff.

Efficient automatic promotion is simple: just put the fixnum fastpath inline and conditionally jump to the bignum functions on overflow/bignum inputs. SBCL (most compiled implementations of languages with implicit promotion, actually) does that efficiently, especially when the inputs are known to be fixnums. Again, since you get direct access to the flags, it's much easier to deal with overflows in the implementation. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As for annotations, I don't like magic that much, so I didn't think of a coercing static type system.
Libertarian economic policy will lead to the destruction of the middle class?  Take a good look around!  The middle class is already well on its way to destruction, and there's every indication that this destruction is a result of over-reaching social programs, unchecked government spending, and a corporate-government compact led by lobbyists that has helped degrade the free market as badly as a socialist agenda ever would. newlinechar  newlinechar MORE government intervention is rarely a solution to broad economic problems long term.  For every example you give me where you think it's worked, I can give you 10 that has failed miserably.  Number one would be the United States.  The greatest economic nation on earth for years and years is being crippled by it's own government because it is becoming ever more bloated and corrupt.  Without some type of change that shrinks its size and delegates a portion of its power back to the states, this country is going to nosedive.   newlinechar  newlinechar I am not wearing rose-colored glasses, and there is no such thing as a short history lesson.  I do not need a lecture from someone who believes otherwise.

It could easily be seen as an attack.  It implies that religion, as a whole, is responsible for 9/11 and other things.  A nativity is simply a celebration of the birth of Jesus.  It does not claim that atheism is responsible for something like 9/11. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not totally against the poster, but it is obviously not the same sort of expression as a nativity scene.
This depends on the size of the country. newlinechar For example, in holland, which is very small, most will speak english good enough to explain say, an abstract math problem.  newlinechar  newlinechar The reason is size. Majority of the movies and tv-series we see are American, British, Australian, etc. Not the majority, but still a huge part, of all the books we read are in english as well. newlinechar  newlinechar Bigger countries, like Germany, dub the foreign movies and series. We only have subtitles. Which means we always hear English, then read the Dutch. newlinechar  newlinechar Off course, by the age of 14 you no longer read the subtitles.  newlinechar  newlinechar And i'm not even touching Internet and Music here.  newlinechar  newlinechar The point is we consume more content, than we could possible produce in our own native language. Even dubbing movies with a voice-over is too expensive and generally not preferred.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you live in Holland and you can't speak English, I doubt you can really take part in our culture.

There is a stigma for middle/upper-class parents about sending their kid to a trade school.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And there's that thing where older relatives ask the kid what they want to be then TELL  the kid that they should want to be a doctor or a lawyer, or (forefend) president.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar When they asked me what I wanted to be, I said 'Evel Knievel', and he's dead now. *sniff*

Japanese and English are completely unrelated to each other from a language standpoint, but loan words from one have started cropping up from the other as there is more interaction between Americans and Japanese. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know about the history of loan words between Swedish and Finnish, but I believe that is what the grandparent post is claiming.

I was hoping someone had made this point already. If a kid grows up in a state where the university has a great football team year after year, he will grow up a fan of the team and be much more likely to go there rather than out of state.   newlinechar  newlinechar I go the University of Minnesota and we have terrible sports teams.  Although it's a great university, only 25% of students come from outside Minnesota and bordering states.  Good sports teams=more national publicity.
I grew up with food allergies and I think this is borderline paranoid on the part of these kids and their parents. Part of having a 'disability' is learning to get along in the real world.  Once these kids are out in the real world, are their universities, workplaces and restaurants going to have to cater to this too? 
It is a measure of all new projects coming online in the next few years by using their peak oil output. Only actual projects with actual pipes and people working on them are counted. It basically says that at a maximum, we could see 2 million barrels per day added from these projects in 2008 and 2009. If depletion is running at 2.5% globally, these new additions will mean that oil production will remain flat. If depletion has not set in (i.e. we are still pre-Peak Oil), then we could see up to 78mb/d out of the oil system. That would mean lower prices for the next few years. newlinechar  newlinechar So it is both a blessing and a curse. We probably won't have a real peak in the next few years, but that could make people think that we don't have serious structural problems with oil supplies. By 2010, the output from these projects will return to 2007 levels and remain there for at least 4 years. Depletion is very likely to show it's ugly head at that point. newlinechar  newlinechar Hope this helps.

The whole, 'Remember the true meaning of Christmas is Christ.' thing always cracks me up. newlinechar  newlinechar The true meaning of Christmas is that it is a celebration of the winter solstice. newlinechar  newlinechar Saturnalia, Natalis Solis Invicti, and Yule are the true meaning of Christmas.

&gt; Is marriage a civil liberty or a religious liberty? newlinechar  newlinechar It's both. That's part of the rub. But as long as there's [those 1,138 legal benefits, rights, and privileges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_and_responsibilities_of_marriages_in_the_United_States) that come with marital status, it's a civil rights issue. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd favor eliminating those 1,138 benefits or otherwise separating them from the religious institution of marriage. But in either case, as long as those benefits exist, they're constitutionally obligated to dole them out in a gender-neutral way. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It essentially gives 'special rights' to a segment of the population. newlinechar  newlinechar Equal rights != special rights. To my knowledge, gay couples are not asking for any rights above and beyond those that straight couples currently enjoy. What's special about them? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If they were indeed civil rights, then the constitution would already protect them. newlinechar  newlinechar 14th amendment, equal protection under the law. This is a rather straightforward application of it; see my reply to HukdUnFonx for an elaboration on that point. newlinechar  newlinechar The liberties are already guaranteed to you, they're just being denied.

Well the article in question refers to outlawing an opinion, which would be a violation of the First Amendment.  Hate crimes, at least in the American sense, are not at issue in this article. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But I will have to say that I don't understand why conservatives are against hate crime legislation.  After all, don't conservatives want criminals to spend more time in prison?  Therefore, any law that gives more time to people who commit assault should be a positive. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That motive is taken into account should not be a reason to discount hate crime legislation.  After all, motive is a factor in whether a crime is committed.  If someone deposits $9,999 into a bank it is a crime, but only if their motive is to avoid the automatic notice to the IRS if 10 G is deposited. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Even murder charges are based heavily on motive.  If someone kills their spouse to collect insurance money, that is 1st degree; if they kill them because they just found them in bed with someone else, that is 2nd degree or manslaughter; if they kill in self defense, that is not murder at all. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Logically, society has chosen to give harsher sentences for crimes that are more heinous.  If an assualt occurs because the victim is of a different race I think that is can fairly be seen as a more heinous assualt than an assault that was the result of a verbal argument, for instance.
That's what I worry about though. If they keep the function aliases in the global namespace, that keeps the crappy functions in usage that much longer, and makes the transition that much more difficult and confusing.  I would love for them to simply break *all* compatibility with PHP4/5 and just have everything rely on the namespacing from the start, and redesign the function library to actually have consistent naming/parameter schemes for once.

&gt; In the past, image formats were implemented in all browsers on the basis of what was popular. This was almost a financial disaster with GIF, if anyone remembers. newlinechar  newlinechar GIF wasn't created until two years after HTML 2 specification was written.  If HTML 2 had got involved with image formats, then it would have probably been something like XBM selected, which seems ludicrously outdated these days.  When HTML 5 gets widely deployed, it's probable that the same thing will be said about Theora, if not at first, then certainly later. newlinechar  newlinechar The worse situation, of course, would have been if GIF had become popular before the HTML 2 specification was written.  If you recall, virtually nobody was aware of the patent problems with GIF until long after it became ubiquitous.  If an HTML specification had selected an image format in the late 90s, it would have been the patent-encumbered GIF. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: For the people modding me down, please read past the first paragraph.  The fact that I was off on the timeline doesn't mean my comment is without merit, in fact it makes it all the more pertinent.  If HTML 2 took the same approach with `&lt;img&gt;` as HTML 5 is doing with `&lt;video&gt;`, then the specification would have recommended GIF, which we now know to be patent-encumbered. newlinechar

Ok. Going to try to explain this one more time and then give up. Monads are not fundamentally about sequencing (even though they can be used for this -- `seq` can too, for example), and certainly not fundamentally about IO. In fact IO is sort of a 'magic' monad in that it nearly *uniquely* doesn't export its constructor. unsafePerformIO, while it has to do with IO, also has nothing to do with sequencing, and doesn't solve any issues with laziness and indeterminate order of execution.  Hence, from the documentation: 'This is the 'back door' into the IO monad, allowing IO computation to be performed at any time. For this to be safe, the IO computation should be free of side effects and independent of its environment.' In other words, if you use unsafePerformIO to add monadic effects (as distinct from Monads) to code later on, you are being a bad programmer and inviting disaster.

What isn't covered, but what everyone should consider is this gives us more time to get the alternatives to a useful point.  There are a lot of interesting renewable projects out there.

The end of oil has been predicted within a few years since at least the 1880s (not 1980, 1880).

I remember a presentation by one of the Sun Java guys back in the days of Java 1.1. He said that there would be no more changes in the language, but all enhancements would come through additions to the libraries. It had been difficult enough going from 1.0 to 1.1, and they weren't going to make a change like that again. newlinechar  newlinechar The idea was that as Java became more ubiquitous, it should become more static. I think they held on to that philosophy for a long time until C# started putting pressure on them.

Except that you have to add a sizeable contrivance to your lexical analyser to account for the lack of braces (basically, the lexer adds them after mangling tabs to be spaces and maintaining a stack with the current indentation level. I've always believed that if you need to explicitly create a stack in a lexer then you are doing it wrong). newlinechar  newlinechar It's the same argument as not explicitly ending lines. Once you've done that you need to add messy continuations for statements that span multiple lines. newlinechar  newlinechar All of this can be done but it adds unnecessary overhead. Also it removes any possibility of structuring your code in the way you want (some might consider this a good thing, I personally don't want my hand held, besides you can easily create a program that mangles code to your preferred style).

I realize NULL completely borks relational algebra, but suppose you have an organization that tracks demographic data about people, but often doesn't have complete information. You might have race, religion, marital status, height, weight, and 10 other fields. To be strictly correct from a relational algebra standpoint, since you may or may not have these fields, they should each be contained in their own table. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, there might be a table for race that contained the field(s) to foreign key into person and a field for race that keyed into a lookup table of selectable races. A table like this would potentially be present for each of 20 nullable fields. newlinechar  newlinechar This would be a completely correct implementation from a relational algebra standpoint, and a coding and administrative nightmare from a practical standpoint. Having fields in the person table, by contrast, mucks up the relational algebra, but makes for a database structure that is usable in the real world.

Yes Africa is the source of the human species which is one of the reasons why race is more a social construct.

&gt;there's better things for us to do with that time newlinechar  newlinechar Like bitching about religion. At least most religious people have good intentions, unlike most of the atheists on here. I think you are overexaggerating what atheists have to deal with. I could turn atheist right now, but probably wouldn't notice any difference. You people probably revel in the fact that you are so much smarter and rational than the simple minded religious folk.

Really, society would benefit more from the end of the drug war (or at least part of it) than from the taxation.

Bad news: the earth is overpopulated, especially at our current and projected future rates of consumption. China has taken the extremely difficult, draconian, but responsible tack of limiting population - had they not, can you imagine what their population would be now? Do you think that might contribute to even more problems like desertification, wars (annexation of territory for an exploding population), pollution, etc? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And how is this sentence, from the article, a bad thing: 'Creating Conditions Conducive to Fertility Decline, which calls for, amongst other things, 'reducing infant and child mortality'' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Does the author propose increasing infant and child mortality? In order to avoid drastic measures such as the Chinese were forced to take, and which will be forced upon us by things like the climate crisis whether we 'believe' in it or not, we need to reduce family sizes. Ironically, the things that contribute to smaller families are: newlinechar  newlinechar * Increased economic security newlinechar  newlinechar * Increased infant and child survival rates newlinechar  newlinechar * Peace newlinechar  newlinechar * Education about reproduction newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The U.S. is going in the wrong direction on all those things in the developing world.

&gt; Put anyone in an environment that values hard work and education without distractions and they will do well newlinechar  newlinechar The ability to work hard at writing/reading is related to attentional networks in the brain and those have genetic basis.  Paying attention in the face of distractions also has a number of different genes in control.  The speed at which someone learns new information is also under significant genetic control. newlinechar  newlinechar The end result, is that genetics matters a whole lot.

Not horny psychopaths, just horny guys. 99% of the guys over there would never commit a rape, but there is that 1% that gives everyone a bad name. And even most of them wouldn't have done it if they hadn't been so stressed and horny due to the conditions they were under. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, this appears to have been a rape committed by KBR contractors. These are usually everyday folks providing non-combat services like carpentry, plumbing, etc. I understand that this occurred in Iraq, but as a female contractor your chances of being raped in Iraq are statistically much lower than they are of being raped here, though I don't doubt many cases do go unreported.

&gt; Do you seriously claim Israel has worse human rights situation than Saudi Arabia, Iran or Syria? newlinechar  newlinechar The UN does not vote on human rights abuses unless they are severe.

[EDIT just for dtjb]: **MOST** people in the US believe anything that the media tells them. If you say anything against what is reported by the major networks, you are a wacko.

Part of the problem is that the media is portrayed as the voice of the people, which could not be further from the truth. 
No, don't stop.

&gt;Theora is a great, if not superior than the mp3 format for audio. newlinechar  newlinechar Theora is not a format for audio. It is a video codec, and a poor one at that.

What makes you say that?  The harmonica, kazoo, recorder, and xylophone are all perfectly legitimate instruments even if they are played by children.  It's the sound that counts.  If the guitar is easier to play, then think of it this way: It allows guitar players to concentrate on the notes.
I can't comment very much on media representation, since I don't watch much TV or listen to the radio, but I'd say there has been plenty of focus on Hispanics long before all this recent hubbub about the border.  I admit I may be biased because I live in an area with somewhere around 50% Hispanic population, while during the entire time I was in high school there were only 2 black students (a brother and sister, one a year younger than me and one 2 years older).  But of what media I do see, I certainly haven't noticed any particular lack of Hispanic characters.  I might agree on Asians if you mean Asians acting as stereotypes, but acting as typical Americans who happen to be of Asian descent, I haven't noticed an under representation there, either.  I guess there aren't very many popular rock stars that are Asian, but I suspect that has little or nothing to do with racism.
And all you have to do to burn one off is go for a nice long jog. The cholesterol will take care of itself.
One asian person? And he's also a stereotype asian nerd.

I agree the ad is 10 kinds of misleading.

It was unfounded, but what is worse that before the greenpeace campaign they asked the forestry industry for donations.  newlinechar  newlinechar As the forestry companies did not want to 'donate' for the cause they were taken as target.  newlinechar  newlinechar And in the campaign in Germany they had magnificent trunk of great old tree that they claimed was harvested from Finnish forest. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, too bad that there was police report on theft of that tree.

I hope you are not interpreting Ron Paul's actions in this matter to be a description of his actions or history in general. newlinechar  newlinechar In your statement: 'I agree with Paul on many issues, but to say that he is simply advocating a libertarian / state's rights position is intellectually dishonest,' are you meaning to reference the specific issue of abortion and HR 1094, or generally it is intellectually dishonest to understand Ron Paul as 'advocating a libertarian / state's rights position'? newlinechar  newlinechar I also disagree with Ron Paul on this matter. I don't think an all-or-nothing solution exists for abortion. State's having the freedom to make their own laws presents quite a few issues as well. I think abortion is the issue that most demonstrates that more times than not government and governance will never be perfect.

&gt; Why are Barbie dolls white? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Amazingly enough, there has been a black Barbie since 1968! (I didn't know this before.) According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie#Controversies): 'The first African American doll in the Barbie range is usually regarded as Christie, who made her debut in 1968. Black Barbie and Hispanic Barbie were launched in 1980.' Regarding another Barbie model, the article says 'as had become the custom, Mattel manufactured both a white and a black version.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So apparently there are black Barbie dolls, although I don't think that I have seen any advertised. That makes sense, though, considering that blacks are a minority and the advertisement will probably be most effective if the doll's skin color is the same as that of the majority of viewers. That brings us to your next question... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Do you think racial preferences should map to current demographics - thereby justifying a 'tyranny of the majority? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Well, whether they 'should' or not: they do. Market forces drive advertisers to follow the money. Modern advertising is a 'tyranny of the majority' with respect to ever single issue, not just race. Alternative lifestyles are not depicted in mainstream advertising, because that's not going to win customers. Race is no different. It simply doesn't make financial sense to target a minority group when there is a larger group that could be targeted for the same cost - and advertisers can't be expected to take financial losses in order to make ads that represent minority cultures, lifestyles, and races. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This situation has the effect of portraying majority lifestyles/cultures/races/etc. in glamorous circumstances, with no corresponding portrayals of minority groups.

I disagree that the 'imagine' statement was fighting dirty in any way.  I'm a christian and it really irritates me that Christians can be in any way offended by this kind of thing.  The sign doesn't say 'fuck you religion' (which personally, wouldn't offend me either), it said '*imagine* no religion'.  How can someone be offended by someone just telling them to *think* about something?

One flaw in the reasoning in this video is the idea that the planets are formed by impacts from small bodies that come from random directions, and all with the same momentum. The spin of the planets is because they are formed by collisions among smaller bodies that are already rotating around the Sun. Loosely speaking, they transfer their rotation to the forming planet. Of course, there is a degree of randomness in this, so a collision with a particularly large body, as you expect towards the end of the formation of the planets, can significantly alter the rotation rate and axis of a planet, at random. This would explain the anomalous rotation of Venus, or Uranus. It's interesting that we can observe this process happening around another star, Beta Pictoris, which is surrounded by a spinning disk of debris, and where a [violent collision](http://www.gemini.edu/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=117) between orbiting bodies has happened recently. newlinechar  newlinechar The four large moons of Jupiter (the Galilean moons) are thought to have formed together with Jupiter, out of a disk of material spinning around the planet, like the larger nebula spun around the protosun. They orbit Jupiter in the same direction, as expected. Other moons are small, irregular bodies, wandering planetesimals in fact, captured by Jupiter's gravity. These would have approached Jupiter originally from random directions, so they would not be expected to orbit the planet in the same direction.  newlinechar  newlinechar The statement that the gas giants could not have formed spontaneously because gas dissipates into space is ludicrous. The giant planets' gravity is quite sufficient to retain hydrogen atmospheres. The terrestrial planets, on the other hand, are much smaller and their gravitational pull is weaker, and they can't retain hydrogen. Mercury can't even retain any atmosphere at all. Our planets can retain thin atmospheres of heavier gases - fortunately for us! newlinechar  newlinechar The statement that the Moon's composition is very dissimilar to the Earth's is just plain wrong. In fact, the composition of the Moon is remarkably similar to the Earth's crust. The favored theory of the formation of the Moon is by an impact with a large body. [Computer simulations](http://www.swri.org/press/impact.htm) show how the Moon forms out of the debris ejected from the Earth by the impact. newlinechar  newlinechar The formation of the solar system is a fascinating story, built up from observations of the dynamics of planetary motion, analysis of meteorites, and of course more recently, exploration by spacecraft, and in the case of the Moon, by humans too. It's a much more interesting story than the creationist magical fantasy. 
If you're going to tell me the poor in Asian countries of similar economic status (not many of them! Africa is far worse off.) don't resort to whatever it takes, you're wrong.

I did actually like the IDE, I just felt I needed the obligatory Microsoft is evil comment. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm working in Flash (version 8) at the moment. Now that's an evil IDE.

It also fails to pick up anything remotely useful (no type checking) however it will try and tell my that my class names conflict with themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar When compiling, the publisher will compile the code last (after all graphical resources, etc). So even if you have a simple 'Hello World' project you may be waiting half a minute find you got a type wrong. It doesn't seem to cache anything between compiles either. newlinechar  newlinechar The debugger is incredibly slow. If you add in any Flash components it can grind to a halt. It will occasionally crash the entire IDE, taking all our work with it. If it does actually run then you'll face a 'This script is slow, continue?' dialog every half minute. I have at times spent five or ten minutes clicking 'OK', 'OK', 'OK' trying to wait for the debugger to reach the section of code I need to test.

'Every church has its oddities if you dig for them.'  Actually, you don't need to dig for them any more than you need to dig into the bible to determine that god hates fags.  All these religious groups like to flaunt the word of their god as the absolute truth, until it makes them look silly or prejudiced.  Then it's suddenly 'open to interpretation'.  Even though god made it clear in his bible that his word is NOT open to interpretation, they do it anyway.  I hear stuff like 'well, when the bible was written, such and such was the standard'.  So you're telling me that God could not predict the future?  He was careful enough to fool us all by giving evidence that the universe is billions of years old, but he didn't foresee that in today's society we couldn't take our children out and stone them to death for being disrespectful.  This implies that God made an error.  Basically, to omit certain facts or interpret things differently in the bible is flat out blasphemy.  They're saying that certain parts of the book they define their beliefs from are wrong, the ones they don't like or don't want to be associated with, but the rest is 100% factual, because god said so.  And honestly, none of this matters to me in terms of how electable someone is.  But when they make their religion a cornerstone of their political campaign, it does matter to me.  He brought his religion into this matter.  He needs to explain to everyone why he thinks he has holy underwear, and why black people were inferior until the 70's...

Yeah, that's what I was thinking. The inside of the nose has direct neurological access to the brain.

There is no way to say that all of these cases are abuse because we don't know intimate details. newlinechar  newlinechar I would venture a fairly certain hypothesis, however, that boys in these cases would consent more often, and have less (if any) emotional detriment.

&gt;I disagree. The war on drugs has not and cannot succeed because the general population wants drugs and will do whatever it takes to get them. The general population doesn't want guns - at least not in the same sense. To the extent that the average person might want a gun, it is (to a large extent) to defend themselves against someone else with a gun. Sure, there are hunters and the like, but they are not the overwhelming majority of gun owners. But drug users want drugs whether you or I have them or not. It is not a self fulfilling cycle. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm curious to your reply of my statement: newlinechar  newlinechar There are more gun owners than illegal drug users in America. You probably think more people want drugs because you affiliate yourself with people who want drugs. If I go to the range I am going to find that 10/10 people there would rather have guns than weed. Your response was not factual or based on any hard evidence. Recent polls show that there are 83 to 96 guns for each 100 Americans. newlinechar  newlinechar ( http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0709-03.htm ) I doubt that drug use or desire for legalized drug use is anywhere near what gun ownership rates are. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I submit that if you think all US citizens have the right to own and carry guns for your own protection, then you should agree that every nation has the right to nuclear weapons for the very same reason. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Do you agree or disagree and why? newlinechar  newlinechar 'Mutually assured destruction' has been keeping countries from nuking each other since the early years of the atom bomb. The only time an atom bomb was used against another country as a weapon of war was when America used it against Japan. We also happened to be the only people in the world in possession of the bomb. At that point in time, the only nukes that existed were the ones we were dropping on Japan. Despite the massive proliferation of arms that occured during the cold war, we never nuked each other. Amazing! Of course I am for sovereign nations being able to arm themselves with nuclear weapons! Why shouldn't they be able to? What keeps the haves from breaking the rules and nuking the have-nots? Sure, the have-nots may have allies who will fight on their behalf, but what is the point when their entire population has been wiped off of the map? newlinechar  newlinechar Do you ever wonder why we have shootings in malls, schools, and churches? Well, I sure as hell don't hear much about shootings happening at gun shows or in police stations! Maybe it's the fact that our schools and most public places have had put up signs that say 'This is a gun free zone.' To a medicated nutcase, this says 'You can shoot as many people as you want because nobody will shoot back and it will take the SWAT team hours to finally make entry, but by then you'll have killed yourself, so happy hunting!' newlinechar

EDIT: [Sylvan summarizes it up real well](http://reddit.com/info/62qeq/comments/c02n8y1) newlinechar  newlinechar ----- newlinechar  newlinechar Males and females have different reproductive strategies. newlinechar  newlinechar Women benefit the most from being selective and restrictive. Biologically, they are motivated to get the absolute best quality male they can. That has translated to a socio-cultural tradition that women who aren't sufficiently selective, who don't reserve their fertility for a high-quality and committed male are of lower value; and conversely that any male who coerces or takes advantage of a female is violating her interest in waiting for the best she can get. newlinechar  newlinechar Women have a lot to lose from having sex with the 'wrong' male: years of childcare, and possible social ostracizing. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, males benefit from being sexually aggressive and prolific, and are biologically driven to mate as often as possible with as many women as possible. We can sire offspring then move on to the next woman. That's not the whole of the story of course: humans are mostly monogamous; it's natural for us to select a long-term mating partner and take part in raising children, increasing their chances of survival. But we have very little to lose either from promiscuity or infidelity. newlinechar  newlinechar So, different societal views of relationships between adults and teenage boys or girls aren't necessarily sexist or unfair. An independent, adult woman should absolutely be able to choose her partners freely just as a man can; and teenagers of either gender should be protected against men or women abusing positions of authority or trust to take advantage of them. newlinechar  newlinechar But where a young person willingly engages in sex or a relationship with an older person, whether that relationship is abuse or not can very much depend on the genders of the participants, in addition to their individual maturity &amp; personalities. Where a teen boy may be fully willing and unconcerned with consequences, a teen girl may experience deeper internal conflicts, and face much more serious consequences in life from such an affair. newlinechar  newlinechar -----
