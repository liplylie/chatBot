Actually I think the implication here, which is that you necessarily understand your own interests better than someone else's, is false. As an outsider, you frequently have a better view into someone's prospects and interests than they do themselves. So while I'm not a huge fan of most parents, I do believe they can help a lot in this respect, in the same way that a coach can help an athlete in a competition.

Ann Coulter is a professional troll; she obviously doesn't believe what she's saying, and simply wants to make conservatives feel all warm and fuzzy and piss off liberals because that makes her feel good too.

I don't doubt it will take time.  I also believe we need the strong motivation so that everyone takes action.  A high price will push people into action.  It is the most efficient way to do it.  It will hurt for a while, but people will adjust, they always have in the past.

It is true that abortion would kill the baby.  It is also true that a miscarriage, which can be induced by certain types of exercise in some cases, will kill the baby.  Would you then say that someone who exercises and miscarries is guilty of manslaughter?  What about someone who knows that they are likely to miscarry, and exercises for that reason?  Further, if you believe that a baby has full personhood, may the baby be evicted by the mother?  If not, is her womb some sort of public property, that she does not have control over?

You're absolutely right, of course.  In this were a party in real life, EliGottlieb probably wouldn't get invited back.  That doesn’t mean it’s a good thing.  An overlooked upside of all the anonymity and lack of identity on the Internet is that we get exposed to a less filtered version of people’s views.  It has been repeatedly shown in real life that we can’t resist but conform to prevailing opinions.  I personally find that the original comment has some value, because it makes me question my motivations for reading the link.

You know, the linked article *does* describe a specific case where a LOC metric was applied to real working programmers, so it's evidently not all made up. That said, I do get the impression that the heyday of the simple LOC performance metric was a long time ago (was it a '70s IBM thing?) and that it is indeed a bit of a strawman by now. Nowadays, apparently, there are any number of nostrums for autogenerating productivity numbers for your project. In general they're rather more complicated than just totting up lines of code, though I'm not sure they're really much more useful.
I should mention that this was first brought up [in the Reddit etiquette discussion](http://reddit.com/info?id=34l4#c35ap).

Not submitting something because you don't think it is good enough is self-censoring, I think.  At least, that is what I meant.  And if people could get the equivalent of bad karma for submitting bad stuff, then they would tend to submit less bad stuff. newlinechar  newlinechar Imagine for a moment that 'reddit tenure' was granted to everyone who got over, N karma.  What would the body of links submitted by the tenured look like?  Mostly pretty good, I think.  It seems to me that this would be better than the current system for evaluating academics.

Conceded: some people with anti-religious bias have used evolution as a ramrod against religion. But that is not germane to the issue at hand.

&gt; I refer you to the well-known theorem of Mr. Goedel. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Well known but totally misunderstood, apparantly. For example, see [this text](http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/godels-theorem.html) for an introduction to Godel's theorem. To quote from the article, Godel's theorem is: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar *A much-abused result in mathematical logic, supposed by many authors who don't understand it to support their own favored brand of rubbish, and even subjected to surprisingly rough handling by some who really should know better.* newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I couldn't have put it better.
&gt; You act as though having many old theories replaced by new theories is something unique to economics, when this is actually how the scientific method works. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But unlike economics, our basic understanding of physics is not changing every 10 years or so. Also, the predictive nature of science allows us to do things like put a man on the moon without relying entirely on trial and error. Economic theories are typically useful in understanding and anticipating markets whose members subscribe to the same theories.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It is also important to realize the the formal study of economics is relatively young, and is still growing. It's a bit unfair to compare it to physics, which is arguably the oldest science. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I had been wondering if you could say that economics was simply a primitive science and analogous in some ways to say, alchemy. Even if that were true, we obviously shouldn't base national policies on this kind of theory any more than we should turn the courts over to witchfinders. But we do have economists, who might just as well be reading tealeaves half the time, with huge influence  on government, business and the markets. Russia is an example of a country whose economy was pretty much ruined because they listened to the prescriptions of experts pulling just such a confidence trick. The problem with considering economics as a science is that while an Islamic revolution in the USA would cause a catastrophic failure of current economic theories, gravity would continue as normal. newlinechar  newlinechar

I think ordering comments by points is a good thing, because the quality comments and ongoing discussions are the ones you get to read first, while pointless or bad comments sink to the bottom of the page. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's true though that it's hard to find the new comments on coming back to a large comment section. But ordering threads by seniority won't fix that since a new comment may have been added to an old thread. I guess the 'flat' unthreaded ordering is the only solution to that, though I've never used it myself. Or maybe an option to colour-code the comments by freshness?

What you propose is still not good economics.  It is the moral equivalent of giving the poor free bread as they tried to do in Roman times.  In the movie Gladiator, they made it look like such a noble thing, but in real life, the problems started when the farmers came looking for their free bread. newlinechar  newlinechar Giving the poor money would only create runaway inflation, as was the case in Chile before Augusto Pinochet came to power, backed by the greatest economic team ever assembled. newlinechar  newlinechar The better way to help poor people is not to give them money but to create conditions whereby people help themselves when they help society - in a monetary, not karmic sense.  When social rewards for helping society are only of the latter - not former variety, THAT is bad economics and the fundamental failure of socialism.

An interesting comment except for the logical fallacy and the 1/2 truth.  First the 1/2 truth, the Bible does not say that Adam and Ever were made 6,000 years ago-there is no such verse, the 6,000 year figure that young earth creationists bandy about comes from trying to calculate the number of generations of people going back to Adam and take accounts at face value and add these to come up with the age of mankind.  4 false reports are not evidence that a very different 5th report is also false.  You could have a dozen false reports of human cloning or sustained fusion on earth but you wouldn't be able to reject all subsequent claims as false because the preceding ones were false.  Anyway, as for the Q'ran vs. the Bible, any decent scholar will tell you (if s/he isn't afraid of the backlash) that the Q'ran is a pathetic mish mash plagiarim that attempted to fuse elements of the prevailing pagan rituals with those bits Mohammed understood poorly from Judaism and Christianity.

&gt; It seemed like the OP had as his goal to reduce the impact of Christian aggression in the region or to defray the blame onto the Muslims. newlinechar  newlinechar The Crusades were defensive wars.

At one time, it had part of France on its list, and it would go on to add  all of Asia Minor, and southeast Europe. newlinechar  newlinechar This was not the periphery of Christian lands.  This was its very heart.  To call the Crusades 'Christian aggression' is a bit disingenuous, I think. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, my point was to demonstrate that what occurred in Jerusalem that we are calling an atrocity now was a status quo *law of war* in that era. newlinechar  newlinechar The same cannot be said for atrocities committed the last century by atheistic regimes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Both Muslim and Christian sources say that Jerusalem was a mass slaughter, so perhaps the nature of it was embellished, but the basic fact seems to be pretty much consensual. newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps.

You mean facts like the [NAFTA Superhighway](http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070827/hayes)? or the [Amero](http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/amero.asp)?
see this is where I get confused.  newlinechar  newlinechar what is the purpose of a salt if the salt is stored next to the hashed password? newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, the worry here is that someone somehow breaks into a system and sees a users md5 hashed password. If the hash is unsalted, then the attacker may have a pre-existing dictionary of all of the english words hash values and find that the user's password is 'apple' relatively easy. newlinechar  newlinechar With a salt, the 'apple' string gets turned into something like 'HSeR5apple' before it's hashed, and that salt of 'HSeR5' is stored along side the hashed password in a db somewhere.. right?  newlinechar  newlinechar So the attacker gains priveledged access to the data and finds a hashed password and a salt of 'HSeR5' stored along side it in the record.. that sucks for the attacker, because his pre-established hash dictionary of the english words is no good.  newlinechar  newlinechar However, the attacker can make a new dictionary with every english word from the old dictionary now prepended with the compromised salt value, build that hash table, and do a lookup.  newlinechar  newlinechar So, the obvious advantage of the salt is that the attacker will have to do some work to find the original password, and if each user has a unique salt then the attacker has to go through that work for each password they want to figure out. So with a herd mentality, the average user is statistically kind of safe.. but if the attacker is only targeting one user then is the salt still pretty safe? newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously the salted hash is safer than just storing the straight hash of 'apple', but I guess what I'm wondering is, does it take a considerably amount of time on modern computers to build out a md5 hash table of say 200,000 entries (Assuming 200K english words prepended with whatever salt is found for the user who's being attacked)? newlinechar  newlinechar It seems like if the hash is compromised, the attack is somewhat trivial, because the salt will likely also be compromised, correct? Or does this salting protect against something I'm not aware of? Are people doing MD5 client side before sending it over the wire or something? Perhaps my assumption that the md5 happens severside before persistence is the flaw in my understanding here..?

Good point.
Perhaps at that age. But preferably you want to have a thing called 'savings', and not just of the retirement variety. You also want to be confident in your own skills and employability, whatever that takes. newlinechar  newlinechar You'd be amazed how empowering those two things are. And when you're empowered, you tend to make more money and be less stressed. newlinechar  newlinechar The moral of the story is: Start saving your damn money, it's a lot more important than buying a new computer or an extra $100/month in car payments or all the other luxuries that people tend to bog themselves down with. And then make sure you're the best you can possibly be at whatever it is that you do. newlinechar  newlinechar You should never be worried about losing your job. I'm not. I used to be, but not anymore. At my old job I got a letter of reprimand for a bullshit reason (after working almost 30 hours, through the night, to fix a few extra bugs before we went gold, they were angry that I left two hours early the next day to go home and sleep) and my two weeks notice was on my manager's desk the following morning.
It's definitely getting better. newlinechar  newlinechar Now we need a [religion] subreddit.  Seriously, if you look at the front page right now (without [politics]) there are at least 5 if not 10 religious (atheism, catholicism, christianityism [why not?])  What if we don't care for that? newlinechar  newlinechar They REALLY need to get the ball rolling on tagging, which is _supposed_ to alleviate all these woes.  I have a sneaking suspicion that a) they're finding tagging WAY harder to implement than they thought and/or b) [their implementation of] tagging isn't as effective as they thought.
it is a stump speech - that's not being contested.  no one can show what they will do as president before they are president. newlinechar  newlinechar the only thing we can do is evaluate the campaign, the lives, the character, and the policy positions of the candidates.  Obama's campaign has been substantiative, but more, it has been a 'process-oriented' campaign.  politicians love to promise what they will accomplish - but they cannot accomplish many things on their own. newlinechar  newlinechar by running a 'process-oriented' campaign, Obama is focusing on promises he can keep, by explaining how he will do things and what procedures he will institute as president.  his transparency initiatives are a great example.  he doesn't need Congressional approval to make executive branch actions more transparent (even arguably to make Congressional ones too - though he is one of the sponsors of a bill to this effect now), and this accomplishes an important procedural objective - making information more accessible which theoretically leads to a better informed public. newlinechar  newlinechar Clinton and most of the rest of the candidates promise specific things like health care; Obama has a specific and substantive health care plan as well (like Edwards, Clinton, Giuliani, Thompson, and McCain).   newlinechar  newlinechar you really cannot say that any of the major candidates 'lack policy' - they produce policy papers on many issues.  the questions are: what are they hiding?; will they be able to accomplish these goals?; how will they do so? newlinechar  newlinechar Clinton makes a fetish out of never discussing how she will do anything, focusing instead on her goals.  Obama makes a point of discussing his thought processes, his approach, and the goals, as if all were important.

'There are no facts, only interpretations.'-Nietzsche newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Is that a fact? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Relativism has become such a dominant paradigm among those with liberal arts educations that you'll frequently encounter 'educated' people unwilling to stand by facts and fight for the truth because many doubt there is such a thing as truth.  The passage from George Orwell below is worth taking to heart by all people who find this trend horrifying. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'I know it is the fashion to say that most of recorded history is lies anyway. I am willing to believe that history is for the most part inaccurate and biased, but what is peculiar to our own age is the abandonment of the idea that history could be truthfully written. In the past people deliberately lied, or they unconsciously coloured what they wrote, or they struggled after the truth, well knowing that they must make many mistakes; but in each case they believed that 'facts' existed and were more or less discoverable. And in practice there was always a considerable body of fact which would have been agreed to by almost everyone. ... It is just this common basis of agreement, with its implication that human beings are all one species of animal, that totalitarianism destroys. ... The implied objective of this line of thought is a nightmare world in which the Leader, or some ruling clique, controls not only the future but the past. If the Leader says of such and such an event, 'It never happened' — well, it never happened. If he says that two and two are five — well, two and two are five. This prospect frightens me much more than bombs — and after our experiences of the last few years that is not a frivolous statement.'  newlinechar  newlinechar 
&gt; That is, Congress may enact and repeal legislation, not the president. newlinechar  newlinechar What I said has absolutely nothing to do with enacting or repealing legislation.  As for enforcement, I suspect Congress would have a very difficult row to hoe on that one.  I am not a lawyer, and I haven't read the full federal legal code, but my understanding is that having a drop-off point in each state's capital with strict instructions for the general citizenry to voluntarily surrender assets to those offices, enforcement falling to local police, would be sufficient to suit the letter of the law. newlinechar  newlinechar Ironically, that would probably in fact be more efficient than the current system (in my humble estimation), though the gross proceeds would of course drop off precipitously and send Congress into a panic.

Thanks for the link to the text. An impressive statement, and I agree with it. The contrast with the US of today is really staggering. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it all boils down to media control. Media control translates to mind control of the masses. I found some [statistics](http://www.csun.edu/~vceed002/health/docs/tv&amp;health.html) about TV-use in the US. In contrast to idealistic notions of long ago, a TV-set that plays prevents independent thought and discussion, with few exceptions. In theory that need not be, and there are some programs well worth watching of course, but in practice it works out that way. This is used on purpose, to exert control over what happens in a democracy. newlinechar  newlinechar The effect of all this is devastating, as any person still thinking can see.

You are not a cryptographer. To a cryptographer, something is 'broken' when it can be attacked faster than bruteforce. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, DES was never broken in the first place.

Individuals making up a group *may* want to maintain their position of power (though in the case of american whites, I think it's generally not the case). But each member of the group has individual incentives not to do this. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a classical tragedy of the commons. Helping your group is a 'public' good (with 'public' restricted to mean 'only white people', 'only women', etc, not the public as a whole). Helping the group may mean hiring only whites, dating only whites, etc. Helping yourself means hiring the most qualified person available, dating the most beautiful women available, etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar Most people will perform the selfish acts, unless there is some external force that will punish them for doing so. newlinechar  newlinechar It's much like environmental regulation. Collectively, we want clean air. But an individual factory owner has the incentive to pollute more since it will earn him money.  newlinechar  newlinechar (Note: Before anyone accuses me of it, I'm not saying that hiring a black person is morally equivalent to polluting. I'm saying it's economically comparable, in the sense that it is a selfish act that harms the 'public', with 'public'=='white people'.) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The rich, a group made up of rich people, do this every time they vote for bogus 'trickle down economics.' newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure that's actually true. newlinechar  newlinechar Voting is funny business.

No, not at all. I merely said sex that results in pregnancy shouldnt be terminated for the sake of inconveniance.

&gt; Also, DES was never broken in the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar What about the well-known differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis attacks against single-round DES?

Making fun of windows is a meme that propagates through installing windows on computers. newlinechar  newlinechar The meme is only expressed when a human uses the computer with windows and therefore starts making fun of it. newlinechar  newlinechar But I guess no one would install windows without having heard of it, so I suppose that makes windows a meme that propagates using humans but is only expressed on computers :)
The resistance wouldn't come from the Sunni Muslim countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE etc... it would come from Shi'ia militias in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and so on.

For the sake of context, I'm essentially Diest in my 'religious' leanings, but nevertheless hold the view that human rights must be taken into account for an unborn fetus. I also am the father of 2, and just learned that my wife is pregnant (a big surprise, unplanned) in our mid-40's, so this issue of abortion is very very prevalent to me. FWIW, we'll be welcoming the new child into our family, despite having to adjust alot of future plans. newlinechar  newlinechar I think an essential point to consider in this matter is 'natural development'.  newlinechar  newlinechar A sperm or an egg, or  an arbitrary bundle of human cells, will not develop on their own into a mature human being as a natural course. A fetus, from the moment of conception onwards, will (usually) develop into a mature human -- insofar as the necessary environment, nutrients, etc. are provided for. newlinechar  newlinechar The same can be said for an infant that has been born. If one does not provide the necessary environment, including nutrients, shelter, etc. to a newborn infant, or even an older child, it will not survive. Its natural development will cease. newlinechar  newlinechar The equating of a fetus to 'just a bunch of cells' misses (or deliberately avoids) this key, even pivotal, point. newlinechar  newlinechar This period of natural development begins at conception, not at some later point in time, although there is a recognized point in that development when an external environment can be provided by medical staff sooner than is normal. newlinechar  newlinechar This whole debate, to me, centers around whether a women can be required to provide the necessary environment (i.e. her body/womb) for a fetus to naturally develop to that point of maturity when the responsibility for a sufficiently sustaining environment can be transferred to another. newlinechar  newlinechar So, if one takes the view (as I do) that the unborn fetus has human rights from conception, since given the right environment it will (barring termination by act, disease, etc.) develop naturally into a mature human being, there is a conflict of rights between those of the fetus and those of the mother. Who's rights should take precedence over the other's? newlinechar  newlinechar Should the rights of the fetus to develop naturally trump the rights of the mother to decide whether to provide the environment for natural development. That's the question. newlinechar  newlinechar Saying that the fetus is 'just cells' is IMO just a convenient way to avoid the real question of rights of the fetus vs. rights of the mother. newlinechar  newlinechar Note that none of the above is based on any 'religious' view or belief whatsoever. newlinechar  newlinechar Note also that I don't advocate above any specific position on whether the rights of the fetus always trump the rights of the mother -- I'm just arguing that (a) a fetus has rights from conception and (b) the debate is about conflicting rights; how the balance of rights is decided is then a legal issue which depends on alot of factors, no different from any other conflict of rights between individuals.

Apottedficus, newlinechar While it's true the ladies look more European - I actually spent a great deal of time matching clothing styles and had some success linking them to the 16th century - it may be that the artist was European and the text was based on local dialects.  To answer you questions, it was common to encode exploration research the same way trade secrets are protected.  These explorers, in addition to looking for gold were also looking for spices, miracle cures, and anything else they might be able cash in on back home.  Since they could be robbed at sea  or have their findings stolen once they returned, they went to great lengths to guard their manuscripts.  You're right in assuming a thief might try to extract (through means that would make waterboarding look tame) the code to unlocking the text, but that would only be the case if the manuscript was recognized at the time it was stolen.  It is just as possible that it was lost in a trunk for years before someone found it - Schubert's 'unfinished' symphony for instance sat in a drawer for 40 years after his death before being discovered.  The history of this document shows that indeed there were those who hoped to sell it but they could not decipher the meaning and that hampered their efforts.

This is **exactly** why we *should* leave it up to the states - this is a *very* difficult problem, and to impose a single answer across 300,000,000 people is not only unwise, but borderline tyrannical. Dr. Paul has often said that for early term fetuses, it is very hard to decide about it's 'humanness' - but the current laws do not make any distinction whatsoever - even 30 seconds before it is born it is not protected from abortion. newlinechar  newlinechar As Dr. Paul, I, and many other believe, the harder the problem is, the lower and closer the decision should be pushed to the people. This gives people more power to make decisions based on how they believe, and allows more opportunities for better solutions to arise. newlinechar  newlinechar All that being said, I personally think Dr. Paul has a right to his anti-abortion position, being an OB/GYN and having to deal with the issue *first-hand*, which is more than you can say about any of the other candidates (AFAIK, none of the others are obstetricians)

His brothers Prometheus and Epimetheus weighed the odds and betrayed the other Titans by an alliance with the Olympians.

At first, the best smart phones use ARM CPUs, so people who want to make CPUs for smart phones make ARM CPUs.  But then the best smart phone CPUs are ARMs, so people making smartphones choose ARM.  The same thing with x86.  The desktop market wanted fast, cheap CPUs and happened to use x86, so the people who make x86 made fast, cheap CPUs.  Now if you want a fast cheap CPU, the fastest cheapest CPUs tend to be x86. newlinechar  newlinechar Beyond basic stuff like that, I think there's a lot of group-think to it.

The 10th Amendment (unenumerated powers go to the States) is what Ron Paul uses as justification for saying that abortion rights are a matter left to the States.

Good question. If you're just hashing passwords, SHA-1 should still serve even though it has been somewhat weakened.

I think that the very fact that the man donated his sperm, and did not have sex with her should imply that he was not intending to parent the child to any intelligent person.

Ok, this does require going a little deeper than the rest of this thread. I think that it's clear that abortion was well known in the time of the Founders, and that it was strictly outlawed and yet also common. We could dig up historical details, but I'm fairly sure we're both broadly on the same page here. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm relatively sure they would have outlawed abortion at a Federal level, had they thought that abortion would ever have been legal and widely available. I think a close parallel is questions about whether the Second Amendment includes cruise missiles :) newlinechar  newlinechar I think the question has changed for three reasons: newlinechar  newlinechar * Abortion is now safe and reliable newlinechar * We understand far, far more about embryonic and fetal development newlinechar * The role of women as chattel is gone, and therefore the rights of women must be re-examined newlinechar  newlinechar Now, not to be pat, but here's one approach: If Ben Franklin or Thomas Jefferson or Tom Paine had been female, knowing what we know now, would they have made abortion a recognized right? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure. newlinechar  newlinechar It's possibly the would simply have said 'this is **absolutely** a natural right and needs no more protection than the right to self-defense, which cannot be abrogated.' newlinechar  newlinechar See the basic approach? I think the issue is that abortion is a natural right, in a control-of-one's-own-person sense, and this is an area where I think we're dealing one level further down the layers of thought from which our recognition of rights emerges. newlinechar  newlinechar What do you think?

There's quite a difference between 'nazi past' and 'being mobilised to Waffen-SS'.

Are you serious?

(emphasis mine). newlinechar  newlinechar Google it, and after Wikipedia and a couple things about trinity university, there's the Catholic Encyclopedia, whose first sentence states: newlinechar  newlinechar 'The Trinity is the term employed to signify *the central doctrine of the Christian religion* -- the truth that in the unity of the Godhead there are Three Persons, the Father, *the Son,* and the Holy Spirit, these Three Persons being truly distinct one from another.' (emphasis mine again) Follow the hyperlink for Son and they clarify that it is Jesus, and expresses his divinity. newlinechar  newlinechar Or, if thirty seconds of internet research is too much, you might recall having read in John 1:1 'In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.' newlinechar  newlinechar In short: It is a central idea of nearly all forms of Christianity (the only exception I know of is the Jehovah's Witnesses and maybe LDS) that Jesus is in fact God.

As I said, I agree the example you quoted is wrong no matter how it's sliced. My guess is the writer had faint memories of the distinction from grammar school but either misremembered or misapplied it. Also, my use of the term 'monolithic whole' was unfortunate; what I meant to convey is that the singular is used to refer to a group or a society or a company as a thing in itself. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's an example that shows the distinction put to correct use: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The Praetorian Guard [the institution] _was_ founded by Augustus. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The Praetorian Guard [the members thereof] _were_ escorting the emperor to the Forum. newlinechar  newlinechar You could, as you suggest, rewrite sentences of the second sort to be more explicit: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The _members of_ the Praetorian guard were escorting the emperor to the Forum. newlinechar  newlinechar And it might be a good idea to do so. It does draw possibly unwanted attention to the 'members' part, and it's less terse and arguably less elegant. But the choice of one or the other comes down to style, not grammar; you'll find the grammatical distinction described in classics such as Strunk &amp; White and Fowler, so I certainly didn't invent it.

Yes and no.  Although mortgage interest is tax deductible in the US, it only matters if the interest you pay is greater than the standard deduction, assuming you have no other deductions to itemize.  With the single standard deduction at $5350 that means that unless your loan balance is over $85,000 or so (assuming typical interest rates), you're not saving anything by deducting mortgage interest.  Of course, you'll probably have other things (such as state or local taxes) to deduct if you itemize, so there still can be a benefit to deducting mortgage interest even with a small loan. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, investing the money is less productive than it first appears, because you have to pay tax on the profit from the investment.  Add in the effects of inflation (which you are effectively taxed on as well!), and your real gains are even lower.

The 14th amendment is the worst thing about the current constitution. It was originally intended to give black people equal rights, but the Supreme court used it to pass federal regulations down to the states. This zapped a great majority of the sovereignty of the individual states. newlinechar  newlinechar So I disagree that the 14th amendment was a step forward. What it was was step in nationalizing everything. The federal laws were never meant to apply to the states and now we are subject to a myriad of federal departments imposing themselves upon the states. newlinechar  newlinechar This is why Ron Paul wants to eliminate the federal departments, to give strength back to the states. newlinechar  newlinechar Have you every seen [Ron Paul's hr300](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-300&amp;tab=summary). This is a bill to restrict the Supreme Court from hearing some first amendment cases. Specially separation of church and state. If you ever wonder why Paul would be against the first amendment, its because it was never originally intended to be applied to the states. The states have their own constitutions and they can simply be amended to contain these rights, but the federal government didn't want that, they wanted to eliminate state authority in the matter altogether. newlinechar  newlinechar Passing HR300 would be a small step to repealing the effect of the 14th amendment.

Compare the number of people who show up at rallys and straw polls - its not just the internet.  Lets not kid ourselves.   If anything, a better argument is that Ron Paul support is only around 10% but that 10% is rabid and show up everywhere giving a false impression of support. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As far as polling, the polls use a database of voters from previous Republican/Democratic primary elections.   It is impossible for his support to translate into the polls - by virtue of how the polls are conducted.   The pollers use federal (and state level) voter databases to generate a list of 'likely voters' (required to be maintained by federal/state law).   This list is based on who voted in that specific party's primary for the last 1 (or last 2 or 3) primaries.   From this list (essentially a majority of Bush/Kerry supporters) they get their numbers.   They never voter registrations and almost never (unless they are targeting this demographic) use recent registered voters.   They get better results from these database lists.   Up until this year, that would be true...voter apathy is pretty consistent and voter turnout for primaries are typical 10-15% for Republicans.   This leaves 85%-90% or the registered voters, who, for whatever reason, did not vote in a previous primary.  It also does not include, by design, 21yr old and younger or republican converts. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Correct, its not a media conspiracy in the literal sense.   But the media is not going to change its polling methods just to determine if Ron Pauls support (easily the front runner in every other indicator except these polls - straw poll/debate poll/rally size/fundraising/grassroots support) extends beyong the Republican base.   I agree, he needs to get more support from his base Republicans.   I just dont see former Bush supporters picking him. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I dont claim he is winning - I think he needs 8% nationwide, or at least a couple wins and strong showings in the other early states. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Its going to be interesting to see how it shapes up in the end.   I think anyone who thinks he has 20-25% overall because of 'cross-overs' or because cell phones are not used are deluding themselves.   In the end it will depend on voter turnout.   8% can beat 25% with a high voter turnout. newlinechar  newlinechar

Hardly.  If you want to explain the origins of something to me in an intellectually honest manner, you either have to explain it using less complicated tools (evolution) or explain why the more complicated tools exist (ID, or the 'who created the Creator').  Logic builds upon 'first principles' - never do we prove our assumptions using our conclusions - and if you want to go outside logic, you're failing to provide an intellectual argument. newlinechar  newlinechar An example: the famous 'first mover' posits that the creator has always existed and will always exist.  Using the logic that 'something' can always exist, then there is no need for the first mover - it's turtles all the way down.  In other words, it's self-contradictory to claim that an uncreated creator explains the beginning of time.

&gt; Now do you see why claiming that god exists without producing a single observation makes you seem like someone who's fallen in love with an imaginary friend? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Let's go back to my original analogy, because you misinterpreted it. Here's an excerpt: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  Not only can you not prove these deeply personal feelings, but the very question of proof is irrelevent in this kind of relationship. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Love is a feeling. Who or what you love is irrelevent to the feeling. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My point was that individual feelings and experiences cannot be proven or disproven. Feelings are at the core of a human being, and there is no way by which you or science can prove or disprove the way someone feels. In fact, this is why we don't require people to prove feelings, because we can't! Sometimes people fake how they feel, or pretend to be depressed, or sad, but we always except them to be true in our society (and in science) unless we have reason to believe the person is lying. Thus, in logical terms, feelings are sufficient for the individual.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Belief in God is also sufficient for the individual. Faith is not a communal act. By its very nature, it is individual, just like feelings. And when someone has faith, they have it. If you don't have it, then you don't have it, and just because you don't feel that way does not mean someone else can't feel that way. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Another example: A sociopath cannot feel empathy. Yet you can (I'm assuming you aren't a sociopath). No matter how hard you try, you will never, ever be able to convince a sociopath that empathy exists. It simply is non-existent from a sociopath's perspective. It cannot exist, and if it did, it would not make sense. To a sociopath, human beings have no value except the value they can provide to the sociopathic individual. They do not care about human beings, and the fact that you do proves to them nothing. To them it just shows that your way of looking at the world is crazy, while their way is normal. When in fact, we know that sociopaths aren't normal, and their non-empathetic way of looking at the world is in fact the true mental illness (of course, they don't understand this). They see empathy as a falsity - like faith - and a crutch for the weak, when in fact it is a natural emotion in most people. Faith in God is analogous to feelings, because it is spiritual, and spiritual concepts are not applicable to anything but individuals (within the physical world).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Does that make sense?  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The recepient of love was not the point at all, which is why your conter-example is misleading. It does not address my argument. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My goal is not for you to believe in God. My goal is for you to accept the fact that some people are justified in believing in God, just as some people are justified in not believing in God.
All functional programming languages (that I know of) have short-circuiting OR.  I believe the author's problem is that all functions must return a value in a purely-functional language, and so if you've got a recursive call, you've got to check the return value and propagate your True upwards.  Sufficiently smart compilers could probably optimize this away, so I don't think he's really concerned about efficiency, but he dislikes the boilerplate coding. newlinechar  newlinechar Haskell uses monads to hide the boilerplate - if you have a Left (exceptional) value, the &gt;&gt;= (bind) operator propagates that as the complete result of the computation, rather than evaluating any of the other function calls.  'Course, then you have to write your code in monadic style, which often looks a little different from a straight recursive algorithm anyway.
The problem here is not defining 'rights,' but rather, 'child support.'  The law needs to define a certain standard of living that encompasses all aspects of modern life (not simply income) and ensure that all people (not just citizens) are able to achieve it.  'Child support' needs to provide children, not with money, but with adequate shelter, food/drink, health care, etc.  If 'child support,' defined as a certain amount of money, is truly the right of the child, then the checks should be made out to them.  Because of children's lack of judgmental capabilities, this course of actions is not in the child's best interest.  Also, If a father saw that his aid was directly helping the child, and he was not simply writing a check to the mother every month, I would bet that there would be much less animosity between the parents, and possibly less therapy in the child's future.  Changing pace a bit, I think the reason that we hold children in high esteem is actually biologically encoded into us as humans.  Humans reproduce very slowly and therefor much more of an investment is required in every child. (As opposed to spiders, who have a 'fire and forget' strategy for reproduction). newlinechar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_needs) newlinechar  newlinechar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction#Reproductive_strategies) newlinechar

I'm not sure I'd consider languages like Joy to be in a separate group from FP. You could argue that Joy is a function level language where the only operation on functions is composition. More precisely, composition is the only available 'functional form'. By this definition, compositional languages are a subset of function level languages.

That's interesting.

I don't think you'd find many atheists who claim that they wouldn't change their views if they found strong evidence of god. newlinechar  newlinechar You may have a semantic point, but the only practical change you are advocating is that virtually no one should classify themselves as atheist. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you really think everyone should be agnostic towards everything?

I think you speak of the essence of greed and humanity. 'Capitalism' is using money or some other form of capital to move around 'wealth'. It is neither good or evil. A greedy person will horde and cheat against others no matter what people use to move around wealth and resources. This is what caused the failure of 'Communism' in it's respective attempts. It's not about the system, it's about the people. Take a good system and put it in the hands of bad people and the results will be bad. Put a bad system in the hands of good people and you maybe surprised to find that it will end up good.
And you're wrong too.  Your return is the interest you're not paying on that debt.  Mortgages are at what, 6-7% now?  That's your guaranteed return from paying off your mortgage.  It certainly beats T-bills, and is close to the long-term average return on the stock market. newlinechar  newlinechar If it were any debt *other* than a mortgage (including, I believe HELOCs), you can tack an additional 30-40% onto that, because pennies saved are *after tax*.

Bullshit. newlinechar  newlinechar I live in New York and I voted for Nader. Gore took the state and thus the electoral votes in a landslide. My vote for Nader was just that, a vote for Nader. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason the democrat party can't win an election is because for years they've taken their base for granted while the republicans have actively delivered for there base. The fact the dems couldn't put up a candidate that could beat one of history's worst president is disgraceful.  newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore the only real way to destroy the two party system that's doomed us to a 'lesser of two evils' electoral process is to ACTUALLY JOIN THIRD PARTIES.  newlinechar  newlinechar People constantly slam politicans for abandoning principals when they vote on things but the general public gets a free pass? If you as a citizen can't even vote your principles in the primaries representative democracy needs to be overthrown because it isn't representing the true will of the people.

&gt; 'If' being a key word, as ever.. newlinechar  newlinechar The point is that Olmert is comparing the situation in Israel to South Africa in the apartheid era. Otherwise, 'a South African style struggle for voting rights' wouldn't even be an issue. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Apart from that, in what way am I responsible Olmert's opinions? newlinechar  newlinechar You are responsible for stating that the South Africa comparison is 'niave,' [sic] when in fact this comparison has been made at the very highest level of Israeli politics. newlinechar  newlinechar In other words, it might be *you* who is naive, for suggesting that the comparison is ridiculous. newlinechar  newlinechar 
Here's superior IQ in action: newlinechar  newlinechar You attempt at a deductive argument (anyway, I *think* you were going for this...) is invalid. newlinechar  newlinechar You started with 'pertinent to world affairs' and moved to the equivalent of '*part* of world affairs'.  Oops - that's a no go. newlinechar  newlinechar Chavez's mental health would not generally be considered a *matter* of world affairs (even if it may have an *impact* on world affairs).  No one would describe a book written just about Chavez's mental state as a book 'about world affairs' - nor would anyone suggest that someone 'read some books about world affairs' if their intent was to suggest that someone learn about Chavez's mental state. newlinechar  newlinechar It is clear that the response to Mudslag was not a suggestion to learn more about Hugo Chavez so Mudslag would know that Chavez is not insane.  Since the suggestion was given as a potential remedy to Mudslag's alleged ignorance, the content of that alleged ignorance would have to match the content of the suggested remedy.  Since the content of the suggested remedy was not learning about Chavez's mental state, then the ignorance alleged was not an ignorance of Chavez's mental state. newlinechar  newlinechar We are left, then, we the obvious reading of the response:  Mudslag is ignorant of world affairs (when we take 'world affairs' to mean what we would mean when we use the term in everyday conversation).   newlinechar  newlinechar Clearly, then, the criticism is unfounded, as Mudslag wrote nothing that would indicate his or her level of familiarity with world affairs.   newlinechar  newlinechar Since the cause for the allegation of ignorance was not any *demonstration* of ignorance, the cause must lie elsewhere.  There is no other reasonable possibility, given the brevity of Mudslag's comment, other than the preference Mudslag expressed for Chavez's being killed. newlinechar  newlinechar There is of course no reason to assume, from Mudslag's preference that Chavez be killed, that Mudslag is ignorant of anything.  (If you were more clever, you might have made an argument that Mudslag is ignorant of some '*moral*' facts - but doubtlessly this would be too complex an issue for you.)  So, back to my original point:  The inference from Mudslag's preference to Mudslag's ignorance, being entirely unfounded, demonstrates poor reasoning. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

It also provides a very stable ABI.  This is because the mapping to the hardware is usually fairly straight-forward: there's only a few obvious ways to do things.  A struct contains only the elements listed in it, no thunks for lazy updating, no vtables for dynamic dispatch, or RTTI.  This means once an ABI has been defined, it is useful for interlanguage bridges, OS interfaces, etc. Things don't arbitrarily break when the compiler writers find out they can shave a bit of performance out by altering the calling convention.

My wife is a kindergarten teacher in a very poor district.  I can tell you from experience that poor kids are stupid.  (ok, generalities do not always apply) Often low income families don't have time to spend with their kids teaching them what they need to know.  Many don't know that they should be reading to their children, and start teaching them to read before they go to kindergarten.  Those kids come to school knowing nothing, and often have trouble adjusting.  Some only know what they learned from TV.  A minority of those parents recognize the need for their children to get off to a good start, and work tirelessly with them.  These children excel and it has nothing to do with their income, or the funding of the school. newlinechar  newlinechar A lack of money is not what makes the kids stupid, but a lack of parental attention and instruction.  The same thing applies to well funded, and poorly funded schools.  You will get out of your education what you put into it.

You said that subsidizing fertilizer is a bad idea because it makes the country poorer. He responded it's a good idea because it stops people from dying of hunger. newlinechar  newlinechar In other words, in a country where the repercussion for lack of fertilizer is not death by hunger, then you're right that subsidies are rubbish.  newlinechar  newlinechar However, these guys die if they don't have fertilizer, so subsidies of fertilizer though temporarily 'making the country poorer' also save lives and give enough surplus for people to actually diversify their activities beyond scouring earth for food. That diversification of activities is economic growth.

Reason or logic? Like this quote from you from an posting you deleted? http://politics.reddit.com/info/61a5j/comments/c02iwj6
That's the fallacy I was highlighting.  The article is as specific as it gets: whether one commodity in one sector is a free market or subsidized, and what happens to food production as a result.   newlinechar  newlinechar The free market certainly did fail in this case, even according to the American/British studies.  A LOT of lives can be saved by looking at the practical results.  A lot can be lost by viewing it as an ideological issue. newlinechar  newlinechar That's why I intentionally poked holes in the notion the 'Economic Freedom Rank' for the entire nation, from the Heritage Foundation fer chrissake, is somehow relevant either way. newlinechar  newlinechar I'll poke some more in the examples above, and I'll intentionally take the opposite slant to show how easy it is.  Botswana, like most countries in the region, has also has been receiving food aid due to the African famines starting in 2002.  Their hunger rates were on a par with Malawi (*before* Malawi's huge success with subsidies), even though Botswana has 15 times more arable land per person.  Egypt gets $1.8 billion from the US, not $3 billion.  $1.3B of it is military credits; and none of it is food - Egypt gives food aid to other countries.  Libya is right next door, has just as much oil as Egypt, and does just as well in hunger rates without similar aid.  See how easy this is? newlinechar  newlinechar It's not an ideological debate and not about liberty bashers, whoever they are.  People who are starving don't have the luxury - they need to pay attention to what works in the real world. newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt; I don't understand why he thinks the first thing to do with C++ is say 'let's not use these pieces.'  newlinechar  newlinechar I have been using C and C++ for over 15 years. I know a number of people I consider experts in C. However, I have only ever met one person who I think even comes close to being an expert in C++. The language and its libraries are simply way to huge for anyone to be come an expert in all of it. newlinechar  newlinechar On top of that you get three experienced C++ programmer together to work on a new project and they will have three different subsets of the language that they are comfortable with. &lt;b&gt;Thats&lt;/b&gt; when the three coders have to decide which parts of the language they decide to drop.
I don't see why this is modded down, it's a good question. newlinechar  newlinechar In cryptography, you sign things by hashing them and then signing the hash. This is because the signing function is expensive (it takes as long as encrypting the whole file, and the signature will be just as long as the whole encrypted file), but hashing functions are much cheaper (it will be faster and the signature smaller). newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously this only works if you have a reasonable guarantee that the hash function is secure. newlinechar  newlinechar So Picosoft can use MD5 in their digital signatures, release the digital signature, and spend the rest of their time hunting down every single place where the software is distributed, and constantly verify that the file is bit for bit identical. Post lists of software that is distributing modified files, inform every user who will download the files, and go bankrupt. newlinechar  newlinechar OR! they could use a hashing algorithm that has a reasonable guarantee of security.

&gt; They're representing popularity among real organizations newlinechar  newlinechar No they're not. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; which, as you mentioned earlier yourself, is a far more meaningful measure than a random sample of IP addresses. newlinechar  newlinechar That makes no sense. Representation isn't a function of the data, but whether the data has been tested. They could take their data by asking admins at a conference, but unless they can demonstrate why those admins at the conference represent admins who are *not* at the conference, then the data isn't tested. newlinechar  newlinechar The benefit to a *random* selection is that you don't have any selection problems like this. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I defy you to find any organization with a sysadmin experienced enough to install and patch qmail, yet whose DNS domain lacks an MX RR. newlinechar  newlinechar You'll just weasel out of it like you always do. Then claim I said some things that I didn't say simply because you don't know what you're talking about, but here you go `dmvnoc.com` is also AS21863 (and operate 216.169.144.0/20) and doesn't have an MX record. They also run qmail. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; these particular surveys explicitly do not sample the mail servers of parked domains, newlinechar  newlinechar I like how you edited my response. You're a weasel. You said: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And there's no MX record pointing to a mail server unless the domain's owner adds it. And, to spell this out for you, that's only going to happen if somebody is setting up a real, honest-to-goodness mail service. newlinechar  newlinechar And I pointed out you were wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I would also point out that this is contradictory to your argument just two paragraphs ago newlinechar  newlinechar Go ahead and point it out. Quote verbatim. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; DJB's original study is outdated and unverified. newlinechar  newlinechar Lots of people verified it. His method does indeed yield the results that it claims to. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; There is no data to support any claim of qmail being the #2 most popular mail server today newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know that. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Therefore, calling qmail 'the #2 MTA on the Internet' is factually incorrect. newlinechar  newlinechar It might be incorrect. It might not. The fact here is that you don't know. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Studies of businesses and large organizations have shown qmail to be ranked much lower than #2 in the list of the most popular MTAs among real installations newlinechar  newlinechar I don't believe you. I have seen two of your reports and I said they're wrong. I said *why* they're wrong. You haven't demonstrated how they are right, so I reject this. newlinechar  newlinechar As near as I can tell you don't know what representative means. I've tried explaining it multiple times but you ignore it and keep acting like it means something else. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Now, do you or do you not have the data or rational arguments to refute either of these plainly stated and helpfully emphasized points? newlinechar  newlinechar Yes: You don't understand statistics well enough to interpret the data that you think you have. newlinechar  newlinechar I said it's not representative and you thought I meant they were trying to be misleading. *Any* statistician would have known that I was calling them stupid, not dishonest. newlinechar  newlinechar I said that popularity is hard to measure and you said it's easy to measure because MX records *mean something*. I said no they don't, you don't know what you're talking about. When I point out both legitimate sites  lack MX records and illegitimate sites have them you argue that these studies *ignore sites without MX records*. newlinechar  newlinechar Ignoring data makes them wrong. It means that whatever they're ignoring is a selection criteria. Maybe Postfix is the second most popular mail server if you only look at small sites run by people with A+ certification. If that's what these surveys actually demonstrate then they're not interesting at all. They certainly do not measure popularity (number of sites, or number of addresses) on the internet, deployment density (how many installs of postfix per organization), or load (messages per second per install). *Those* would all be *interesting* things. newlinechar  newlinechar If you wanted to measure number of sites or number of addresses the only way to do it would be to do it *randomly*. newlinechar  newlinechar You said I have ignored your arguments and simply said that nobody should have to refute them because you are stupid and mean and weasel-like. I said no such thing and have done my best to reply to *each and every one of your points*.

Thank you very much. ;-) I have one more question: newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously, one could use more than one hash function, and require that all of them match.

We are. Those of us who care, anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately, many Americans don't think it matters that Muslims are dying and are being tortured. They don't believe in Human Rights. They don't think that Muslims deserve the same basic set of human rights as Christians. They think that most of them are probably evil. They blame anything bad that happens to the few good ones on the evil Muslims that made us start a war with them and institute harsh interrogation policies. It is not unlike the Nazis blaming the Jews for World War II. newlinechar  newlinechar They also think that God will make it right for the good ones who were killed and/or tortured in the end. newlinechar  newlinechar It's frightening, to say the least.
Yeh actually in Mootools and Prototype there are great class building tools, simplified syntax etc.  jQuery is more of a utility or base and can be used with these kits without conflict. jQuery and Moo are a bit different but Moo and proto are in the same class.  Using mootools and prototype is overkill as they accomplish the same purpose.  Personally I like Mootools better than Prototype. But if we are talking best javascript kit it is hands down jQuery in my opinion.

Then they are not fit to teach, and should be replaced by their sometimes-less-educated colleagues who are, in the spirit of public service, willing to put in the effort required to help people help themselves become more educated.

It could have been something other than the meat. And yes, proscuitto is divine. I'll reconsider, and since I live with a vegetarian I don't eat too many meals that are meat heavy anyways. I would also encourage you to look into locally grown veggies (good variety of veggies usually, and in general better for you, cept in the winter if your in one of those cold kinds of places). Also, keep in mind that buying meat from ethically run small farms is a wonderful way to support opposition to factor farming and maintain *some* moral high ground, you know should you ever get the prosciutto bug again. Congrats on the wedding by the way, sorry I didn't get you guys a gift :-)

However, the fact is that South Africa is not open to non-white immigration. It is impossible to do so without losing the white national character of South Africa which is by definition a white state. The only way you could allow 'blacks' on occupied territories to become citizens is annexation, which isn't something anyone would want; and even if that happened, who guarantees that once the borders are removed and the communications are open again, they wouldn't go back to bombings when they don't like, for example, taxes or national holidays? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I doubt that anyone who emigrates to the territories and not Israel can get citizenship, not sure though. newlinechar  newlinechar If you are Jewish you get citizenship.

First, a singly-linked list in any imperative language has the same type as a scheme cons list; conses aren't 'needlessly nested'. Second, a nested list is a representation of an n-ary tree, and in any imperative language a search of an n-ary tree will look exactly the same as the purely-functional version: you either have to use recursion on the real stack or iteration with an auxiliary stack.

For example, imagine a blog site where URLs look like `http://www.alltheblogs.com/Suzie/last_weeks_post`.

The real problem with my experience in the American education system is that all of the teachers are trying to save you and understand your problem instead of expecting you to get your stuff down. newlinechar  newlinechar In high school I did jack shit. I should have failed all of my classes. I put no time in, didn't listen to lectures (doodled and daydreamed), and rarely knew what we were studying in the class. But I passed. Why?

Very few humans are mature enough to do more then the bare minimum. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm working on developing good habits now. But yeah.

I would be very happy if Dubai was as great as it's promoted...I think that it would be wonderful to have a Middle Easter city that was completely accessible to Westerners, without the downsides that often happen, and as a Canadian I can't imagine why anyone would be jealous of another country's success.

A negative right to life allows an individual to defend his life from others trying to kill him or to obtain voluntary assistance from others in order to defend his life, but he may not force others to defend him because he has no natural right to be provided with defense. To force a person to defend one's own negative rights, or the negative rights of a third party, would be to violate that person's negative rights.

Ext-core.js is only 85kB, and you get most of the same stuff as jQuery.

Seriously.  The only reason the new company will be called Activision Blizzard is because not too many non-gamers even know who Vivendi is. newlinechar  newlinechar If people even bothered to read the article, Vivendi will be the majority share holder in this merger.  Nothing much, if anything, will change by this. newlinechar  newlinechar *edit: Merger Press Release from Blizzard* ([http://www.blizzard.com/press/activision-faq.shtml](http://www.blizzard.com/press/activision-faq.shtml)) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Q: What are the details of the deal? newlinechar A: Under the terms of an agreement with Vivendi, Blizzard and the other companies that make up Vivendi Games will combine with Activision to form a new public company called Activision Blizzard. We do not anticipate any difference in Blizzard's operations as a result of the combination. Joining forces with Activision will create a stronger and more diversified company that we anticipate will benefit and strengthen both brands. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: What will happen to the Blizzard brand name? newlinechar A: The Blizzard brand name will stay the same as it's always been: Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: What will change with regard to the day-to-day operations at Blizzard? newlinechar A: There will be no changes in the way Blizzard operates. All of the people, processes, and philosophies that have made Blizzard so successful will be preserved. Blizzard will benefit from all-star sales and distribution teams to service our products. In addition, the combined company will be stronger financially, managerially, and operationally. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: How will this impact Blizzard's games? newlinechar A: This will not impact Blizzard's games. We remain committed to providing the same high-quality game content and support that we always have. Development on Wrath of the Lich King and StarCraft II, as well as on our unannounced games, is continuing as normal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will there be any visible differences in Blizzard's logo or packaging/marketing materials as a result of this deal? newlinechar A: No, there won't be any changes to our company name, logo, packaging/marketing materials, or anything else along those lines. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will there be any management changes at Blizzard as a result of this deal? newlinechar A: No, there won't be any management changes at Blizzard as a result of the combination. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will Activision and Blizzard now share development teams? newlinechar A: No, both of our companies will continue to operate as they have previously with regard to game development. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will the release schedules for any Blizzard games be impacted? newlinechar A: No, the transaction will not have any impact on our games, our day-to-day operations, or our release timelines. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will any of Blizzard's offices close as a result of the deal? Or, will any new offices open? newlinechar A: No, all of our offices will continue to function as they have, and we don't foresee the need to open any new offices for the time being. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will any employees move to different offices as a result of the deal? newlinechar A: We don't anticipate making any such moves as a result of the deal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Does this deal include Activision's and Blizzard's international offices? newlinechar A: Yes, every part of our companies in the U.S. and abroad is involved in this deal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: If Activision Blizzard is a public company, does that mean I'll now be able to buy stock in Blizzard? newlinechar A: Activision will be renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc and will continue to be a publicly listed company traded on NASDAQ. You will be able to buy stock in the combined company. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: When will the transaction be complete? newlinechar A: The transaction is subject to approval of Activision shareholders, customary closing conditions, and regulatory approvals. Pending approval, the companies expect the transaction to be completed by mid 2008.

Don't worry - It's not your fault that you actually believe 'It's a symbol of commitment and love' - Those were the actual words used in two TV commercials paid for by De-beers in 1973 and again in 1975. Also there were several 'romance stories for young ladies' published with the phrase 'Diamonds stand for love and commitment' used. After the war De Beers worked with Hollywood to place diamonds in romance movies and musicals. Maybe you haven't seen the movie 'Gentlemen prefer blonde's' but i bet you can hum 'diamonds are a girls best friend' all in all pretty clever huh. No you're not a shill but de-beers knows you are just another diamond customer to be.

I respect your opinion.  I don't mean to flame, but UT3 isn't the name, I think you mean UT2003 or UT2004.  Each region/country in the world has different groups of gamers so I can't speak for them all, but I'm not a kid anymore; since about 1994 I have been playing PC games.  In about 1997/98 I got my own computer.  I never played a Blizzard game other than casually, I played Starcraft on a 486 for God's sake.  What inspired me to spend thousands of dollars on computer hardware (and my 5 or so close friends) was FPS games.  Quake II required OpenGL, which required AGP card, which required a new motherboard.  Every upgrade since then has been over an FPS game, Quake III, Doom 3, Quake 4, Half-Life 2, etc.  I am part of a huge community that plays Counter-Strike 1.6 and Source, and I know that there are huge communities for the Battlefield games and a few other online FPS as well.  So, WoW is a demanding game and all that, but its not the only game ever to encourage an upgrade.

It depends on your engine. In some engines you have to have the fields listed in your SQL in order before it will use the combined index.  Also the combined index may be ignored if you only ask for one or two of the fields. newlinechar  newlinechar Very few applications always ask for the same fields in the same order all the time. newlinechar  newlinechar You have to take it on a case by case basis. newlinechar  newlinechar A good database can give you a report of the top 10 longest running queries every day so you can optimize them. newlinechar  newlinechar Overall I agree with urusai.

&gt;The fineness of a game is relative newlinechar  newlinechar No it isn't.  Sure, certain aspects of any game (like how much fun you can have, or how long you can play at a stretch) are subjective and relative to the player who is playing.  But there are many aspects of Games that can be compaired in absolute terms with all other Games and judged according to how well they are done. newlinechar  newlinechar Things like the Complexity of the Rule Set, Complexity Potential in Player Strategies, Availability of Player State, degree of definition to Progress and Score, degrees to which the Player may influence the Game State, and many others. newlinechar  newlinechar Especailly in Video Games, there are a number of technical accomplishments that can be judged objectivly such as the Security of the Game State, the level of detail that can be rendered at a playable framerate, network latency as it affects playablity. newlinechar  newlinechar In all of these areas, WoW shows a high degree of fine craftmanship, any Game Designer would be proud to have made something even half as good. Controls are responcive and consistant, your avatar's abilites and state are readily available, interactions with other characters and world objects are consistant, progress is easily measured on any of the metrics you might choose. newlinechar  newlinechar WoW is a very easy game to love or hate because it is very well defined and very well made.  You know what you are playing.  It's easy to get into and play and offers some very deep challenges.  It is, in any objective sense, a great game.  Whether you like it or not. newlinechar  newlinechar Its only real failing in my opinion is its rather weak/non-existant storyline.  But given the choice between a compelling Story and a compelling Game; it is trying to sell itself as a Game and I think they made the right call.

'The snap must be a quick and continuous movement of the ball by one or both hands of the snapper, and the ball must leave the snapper's hands. The various rules codes have additional requirements, all of which have the effect of requiring the ball to go backwards to a player behind the line of scrimmage (i.e. in the 'backfield'). The ball may be handed, thrown, or even rolled, and its trajectory and the ball during that passage are called 'the snap'.

I used to be sorta dragged into these very conservative Christian Youth conferences and I still remember several years ago (I couldn't have been more than 12 or so) when the church service started off with a similar video on this gigantic screen when thundering speakers, except this video was 10x as graphic with worms crawling out of burning bodies and screaming and blood everywhere. newlinechar  newlinechar As an atheist, it was appalling to see not only all these literally hundreds and hundreds of preteens to young teenagers scared shitless and crying, but all the little toddlers who were screaming. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, the first two videos weren't really all that bad.

That's what makes them such good money and such a good inflation hedge, especially in times of chaos or disaster.

A careful reading (as opposed to an OMG BIG BROTHER! reading) reveals that the emphasis on them is on the intent on doing violence.  The bill does not claim ideologies are themselves terroristic - it wants to look at people who join an ideology for the purpose of doing violence.  See the difference?   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Plus the definitions ONLY apply within the bill and the committee to be created anyway, so even if the definitions were what people claim, they *still* would not be any threat to anyone's liberty. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And in the meantime, the end result is a whole lot of people are now trying to oppose the government doing something which (I thought) those very same people had been claiming it needed to do - STUDY terrorism and its causes, so rational policy can be made. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And I'm sad that Kucinich has apparently given in to the tinfoil hatters and is opposing it now.

Anecdote: recently I re-wrote a small piece of C code in C++ style. It got smaller with C++ (newer design, why wouldn't it). Then I took out C-style qsort and replaced it with std::sort. I had two instantiations of it, so my C++ code got bigger than with C. With one std::sort only, it was still smaller. I left qsort in there, darn! ;-)

You are absolutely right that for a few high level classes, it makes sense. These are few and far between however. Also, even for some of these classes, the experts who know the field are simply incapable of teaching well. newlinechar  newlinechar BTW, it's not just Math 101, it's also Calc 4, circuits, etc that can be done by teachers. Maybe you want a pro for signals or quantum mechanics, but educators can do quite a lot. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, grad school is BS until you start research. The first year or two is what undergrad should be (classes in your field, motivated students). Once you start research, it's like an apprenticeship, completely different. You are actually working as a scientist at that point.

&gt; Text appears in a column because it is easier for your eyes to pass from the end of one line to the beginning of the next one. It makes for less painful reading. newlinechar  newlinechar On doing some reading a while back, I was interested to learn that evidence does not necessarily back this up, at least on screen.  From http://www.humanfactors.com/downloads/nov02.asp : newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; What can we conclude when users are reading prose text from monitors? Users tend to read faster if the line lengths are longer (up to 10 inches). If the line lengths are too short (2.5 inches or less) it may impede rapid reading. Finally, users tend to prefer lines that are moderately long (4 to 5 inches). newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps it is faster to go from one line to the next with shorter columns, but at the same time long lines mean you just keep reading in a straight line more often? newlinechar  newlinechar You may prefer the conclusions of http://blog.fawny.org/2005/09/21/measures/ instead: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Dyson's research is not a justification for marathon line lengths. It merely indicates that the issue is more complex than in print typography, and, I infer, that categorical declarations are hard to back up with evidence. newlinechar  newlinechar (For my money, the text on that page--and many pages, it seems--is too small.  Maybe I'm going blind.)

I agree. I think the story would have been much more compelling had that part been downplayed.

&gt;Here's the dictator-in-the-making article: 'Art. 230 - Presidential term is extended from six to seven years. The two consecutive term limit on presidential reelection is removed.' newlinechar  newlinechar How so?  How would this make him as a dictator?  Canada has no term limits for a Prime Minister either.  And Canada has in the past implemented the War Measures Act which had very similar clauses in it for a state of emergency. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you think Canada is similar to Venezuela?  Given our quality of life, I'd say our political system works a bit better than that in the US...

Basically. newlinechar  newlinechar If you have any personal or private issues that you're ashamed about or need to hide (such as taking the occasional toke, fucking your wife in the ass on every second Tuesday, or having a mistress), then those are things that a foreign intelligence service will use to blackmail you. newlinechar  newlinechar If the ISI or Mossad comes to you and says 'We know that you and your wife are swingers, work for us or you lose your job', then the CIA wants your response to be 'So what?  They know about it already!' newlinechar  newlinechar (Also, the purpose of the voice stress test mentioned was to zero in on anything that the applicant felt stressful.) newlinechar  newlinechar Again.

From this story, I'd say it's even worse than that. It's more like: newlinechar  newlinechar Anyone with control of broadcast spectrum is welcome to sell their share of the public's attention, or not, as they feel like. newlinechar  newlinechar I suppose the fact that the FCC (a government agency) controls spectrum would raise a bit of a red flag there too.
I totally agree with everything you said. TV        Reporters now a days, as a general rule, are talking heads in the TV News game.  Whatever journalism credentials they have are just good for the organization that employees them... then it can say '73% of our News Journalists are Professionally trained News Hounds'.... it's for PR and little else.   newlinechar  newlinechar Then the 'Reporter' just reads what ever is handed to him by somebody else... what he reads gets called the News, but it was written by somebody who wrote it based on some press release that was issued by the White House, Congressional Staff, or Company PR Flack, etc.  I we, as the public, are lucky... it includes info from each the White House, Congressional Staff and Company's Press Release all in the same report.  But more often than not, it only includes one side of the argument... that side being whichever is the one that best fits the parent corporations view, or wants to be viewed by the masses, as what is the truth.  
I think there's two very different things here. newlinechar  newlinechar Decriminalizing marijuana (or other stuff that is, by and large, mostly a matter of personal choice, say the amount of sexuality or violence in movies, videogames, books, etc) I am fully in favor of. newlinechar  newlinechar However, our current society is inherently complex and specialized to the extent that no individual, no matter how intelligent or well-informed, can possibly hope to be an expert on all areas (choice of medical treatment, appropriate financial products, etc).  So the *laissez faire* approach of saying that everything is the responsibility of the end consumer, and that there is nowhere a concept of fiduciary responsibility or professional ethics, is, in my view, fatally flawed. newlinechar  newlinechar Self-regulation, aka the foxes guarding the henhouse, is also inherently problematic.  While there are problems with [Regulatory Capture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) in government oversight, these occur more often in the US, where libertarian theology helps corporations, than in the other OECD nations.

As it turns out even JWs didn't buy this nonsense until well into the 20th century and it was a major shift in their thinking that had to do with one misguided leader, not the Bible or the founder of their sect: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;After Russell's death in 1916, Joseph Franklin Rutherford succeeded Russell as president of the Watchtower organization. Under his administration Jehovah’s Witnesses depicted uses of blood as heroic and the Lord’s work.[83][84] In 1925, blood transfusion was mentioned in an issue of Golden Age. It reported on Mr. B. W. Tibble who donated blood on forty-five separate occasions. The article highlighted his refusal of payment for donating, and the honor accordingly bestowed upon him by Order of the king.[85] In 1927 the Watchtower organization addressed blood, stating, “God told Noah that every living creature… must not eat the blood…”.[86] In 1931 this was expounded by the Watchtower organization teaching “that it was not the eating of the blood that God objected to, but it was bringing the blood of the beast in contact with the blood of man.”[87] At this time the Watchtower organization taught that human blood was sacred and that it was wrong to contaminate human blood with animal blood.[88] In 1940 while discussing interesting medical news, the Watchtower organization reported on a woman who accidentally shot herself with a revolver in her heart and survived a major surgical procedure during which an attending physician donated a quart of his own blood for transfusion.[89] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;After Rutherford’s death in 1942, the Watchtower organization (under Nathan Homer Knorr’s administration) wrote in 1944, “the stranger was forbidden to eat or drink blood, whether by transfusion or by the mouth” and that this applied “in a spiritual way to the consecrated persons of good-will today, otherwise known as “Jonadabs” of the Lord’s “other sheep.””[90] In 1945, the application of the doctrine on blood was expanded to prohibit blood transfusions of whole blood, whether allogeneic or autologous. [91] While the prohibition didn't specify any punitive measures for accepting a transfusion, by January of 1961 it became a disfellowshipping offence to conscientiously accept a blood transfusion.[92] This represented an admitted shift toward increased strictness by the Watchtower organization imposing additional obligation upon the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses.[93]  newlinechar  newlinechar

Agreed. newlinechar The Iranian Government isn't stupid, that's for sure. After 9/11 Iran offered us help in invading Afghanistan probably knowing the US was going to use 9/11 for an excuse to romp around the middle east and we accepted it. Everyone thought that we would strengthen relations with Iran, but no one seemed to understand that Iraq and Iran were already on the menu after Afghanistan. When we invaded Iraq the Iranian Government knew what was up and knew from the cold shoulder it was getting after Afghanistan that it was to come soon.  newlinechar I'm just gonna spell it out. newlinechar O-I-L newlinechar If people do the research they'll see a few things. newlinechar Like how our troops were moving toward Afghanistan before 9/11. newlinechar It's likely they want the mid east to look like this: newlinechar http://www.globalresearch.ca/images/harita_b.jpeg newlinechar  newlinechar Notice how the 'Arab Shia State' extends into Suadi Arabia's AND Iran's current oil fields? newlinechar Why conquer many countries when you can just create a new one that encompasses all the oil? newlinechar  newlinechar 
Modern video compressors use both spacial and temporal compression - this means a region(s) of an individual frame can be compressed as well as parts of the image that stay the same through a given set of frames.  newlinechar  newlinechar A video 'block'(different terms for different encoders) is an atomic sequence of frames wrapped with information about the block and an index or key to tell the decoder where to place the block relative to other blocks, to form a time line or sequence of sorts.  newlinechar  newlinechar For streaming video sequencing gets complicated because blocks can arrive out of order or corrupted, meaning you have to re-transfer the block or wait until the appropriate one for the sequence shows up. To keep things playing smoothly streaming encoders have to reduce the size of the block so it's quicker to catch up or correct for it. This has several ramifications: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) You have more metadata because you have more blocks with accompanying indices and descriptors. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Because each block has to be atomic and because each block is smaller the temporal compression isn't as efficient -- you have a smaller 'dictionary' in which to find repetition. newlinechar  newlinechar In summary, more metadata and less efficient temporal compression are the reason that streaming downloads are larger. If you're going to do further research into this (I know some of you are) make sure to differentiate streaming and 'progressive download' encoding. Progressive download is a different beast altogether. newlinechar  newlinechar **EDIT:** newlinechar In relation to file systems, an inode is a data structure that contains metadata about a specific, fixed-size block of space on the storage device. It contains information like permissions, path, etc. This data structure is analogous to the one used in video encoding.  newlinechar  newlinechar The comment about smaller blocks pertains to how the file system is configured and how it works. I'm not a file system expert, so take this with a grain of salt - it's just my understanding of how they work: newlinechar  newlinechar  A file can span multiple inodes but it cannot span a fraction of an inode; that is, regardless of how small a file is, an entire inode (block) must be used to represent it.  newlinechar  newlinechar On older versions of NTFS and some EXT file systems, the default node capacity is 4096k. If you have a large collection of small files, this is very space inefficient because the entire 4096k is allocated even if the file is only a few kilobytes in length. To compensate for this, the node capacity can be reduced to make storage more efficient - the trade off is that you now have a larger percentage of space consumed by the metadata stored in each node. Same thing with video: smaller blocks = more metadata. newlinechar  newlinechar Newer file systems have sparse-file support, master databases, single instance storage, etc so the information I've presented here is not necessarily relevant any more. newlinechar  newlinechar **See:** [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_%28data_storage%29](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_%28data_storage%29)

'Choke on a dick.' newlinechar  newlinechar I actually prefer 'eat a dick', it flows off the tongue so much more eloquently.  newlinechar  newlinechar You're right though, I'm such a pathetic misogynist that I troll the internet looking for opportunities to disguise my loathing for women in political discussions... Right...  Everyone is so quick to pull that card, why don't you stop your pussy ass whining and get a life.  newlinechar  newlinechar I have the utmost respect for women, what I don't have respect for is people who are complicit in robbing this nation of it's freedoms. So, woman or not, anyone that falls into that category is fair game in my book. 'Oh, she knowingly lies her ass off to protect murderers (which is what the administration is), but no one insult her in anyway that mentions her gender, because that is just off limits!'

for years I tried concentrating on objects, like a rose, a clock, whatever...(and that may have helped in stopping the thoughts, maybe it gave me the exercise I needed to get to where i got), but then it happened where stopping all thoughts brought it too a whole new level. newlinechar  newlinechar To stop the thoughts, I simply pictured them rushing over my forehead, ya know, laying down meditating.  As I pictured the thoughts I began to slow them down, the visual image of those thoughts slowing down over my forehead helped.  Eventually it slowed down enough to a point where you really aren't thinking of anything, and that's when you dive down into the Sub-Conscious.  You will feel this physically and mentally.  You will kind of feel you have felt this before, it's like a deja-vu.  Perhaps cause it's truly a part of you. newlinechar  newlinechar I feel that it's your thoughts that are stopping you most of the time to get to the core of the discovery process.  Once in that core though, in that hypnotic state, is when one should then meditate on a flower or a thought or a problem. newlinechar  newlinechar How has this helped in life?  I can't really say.  But I do love the exploration.

'The international legal rules governing the use of force take as their starting point Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which prohibits any nation from using force against another. The charter allows for only two exceptions to this rule: when force is required in self-defense (Article 51) or when the Security Council authorizes the use of force to protect international peace and security (Chapter VII).' Therefore the war is illegal by at least the UN's standards. Arguing the war is legal is like arguing waterboarding isn't torture. You can argue it but it goes against all logic and legal precedent. I can argue the world is flat, but that doesn't make it so.

It's issues like this that polarize the nation in completely unproductive ways.  Not to mention the fact that religion deserves no place in politics what-so-ever.

He's a crazy, scary Christian fundamentalist just like Bush. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I guess he could appoint pro-life judges, but he can't just stop abortions. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Right.  And once again relegating abortions to back alleys is a GREAT idea!  This numbnuts wants to take us back 60 fucking years poltically and socially. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I don't think I'm the one who has trouble with black and white. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar What the fuck are you talking about?  According to you, if I'm not a Paul supporter, then I'm pro war, pro torture, and pro imperialism.  How is that NOT having issues with a strict 'black and white' view of the world? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm asking you to take a more nuanced view than 'Republican bad, Democrat good!' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The Democrats and Republicans, in general, are no different from one another.  They both want to grab all of the income of middle America and throw it into their pet programs.  I just happen to think that, very generally speaking, the way Democrats spend my money is better than the way Republicans do.  That and I'm very pro-social programs.  Could there be a Republican that I could support?  Sure!  I'm open to the idea.  There hasn't been one in the 21 years that I've been at or above the voting age though. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm a NY Giants fan. They only get into the playoffs if Pittsburgh beats Tampa. Just because you don't like Pittsburgh doesn't mean it's a bad thing to root for them for once. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You realize that this is hoe the US got into trouble in the Middle East, right?  The enemy of your enemy is not necessarily your friend.  What idiotic logic. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And I'm sorry, Paul being anti-war doesn't automatically catapult him to the top of the Republican list.  All the issues need to be weighed out, not just a single one.  And the incredible amount of horrendous ideas that this fruitcake has as a platform far outweigh his war stance.  I didn't really think that that would be possible, but I was wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar

Shorter helps, seeing as Pynchon manages to cram a novel's worth of information in less than a paragraph (and might teach you a new mathematical equation along the way).  Gravity's Rainbow at times feels like reading a novelized history of the entirety of Western civilization, including all the things its philosopher's pondered, its scientists invented, its politicians schemed, and its everyday folks feared and lusted after and obsessively dwelled on... plus the added intellectual tango of Pynchon turning all those ideas inside out and seeing how many different and newly illuminating ways they can be stacked up.  Which is awesome.  And also... ow, I think my brain just exploded.
It's archaic, but probably still technically correct. CS Lewis used 'to morrow' in the Chronicles of Narnia, and those were written in this century.

Nuclear war has been averted due to MAD, mutually assured destruction. MAD only works if you believe in consequences for your actions.

What's so great about it?  I started it a few times, but it just didn't seem very compelling.
I never try to turn things into fights. If you'll check my post history, i think you'll note a consistent de-escalationist policy. newlinechar  newlinechar part of our disagreement is because i misinterpreted your (vaguely worded) statement about 'attempting to understand the nature of god'. you should be more careful about the use of pronouns for interchangeable parties. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I double-dog-dare you. newlinechar  newlinechar whip one out. check the section on 'newtonian mechanics'. now, find the part where it describes behavior at relatavistic speeds. what's that? how about the part where those equations dont work on other planets, or are not the same at different altitudes? (some books might mention that, but most don't). newlinechar  newlinechar you are making the SAME mistake you accuse me of. i do not imply that high school physics books contain all of, or substaintially represent science. they are simplifications, distillations of a complicated or abstract system into a set of rules to follow to arrive at an answer. as such, they are false in any situation which does not match the ones for which it was intended. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So, anybody that attempts to adhere to the rules of some religion is following something that's provably wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar you make a statement in which you make a parallel by replacing 'the rules of some religion' in a statement with 'something that is provably wrong'. you are therefore stating that religion is provably wrong. any 'fifth grader' would possibly have trouble articulating that idea - what exactly *were* you trying to say, if not that religions are proveably wrong? were you implying that *some religions* are provably wrong? let's go for non-obvious here. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You're failing to make a distinction between judging an idea to be wrong, versus not tolerating that idea at all. newlinechar  newlinechar you're failing to make a distinction between a group of people and an general class of ideas which they have in common. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Or, at least, provably false. newlinechar  newlinechar i'll need that definition of 'religion' here. i can do a more general proof that shows that, in order for this to be wrong, you have to define religion in a special way such that the two statements are the same (circular definition), but that's a much longer proof. toss me a definition and i'll have a go. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I can judge a particular idea to be wrong, without negatively judging the character of the person adhering to that idea. newlinechar  newlinechar yes, you can. but since you were defending the statement 'And BTW, the problem with religious people isn't that they're smug. It's that they're wrong.' I assumed that you agreed with it. You didn't personally say anything bigoted, I admit, but the statement you were defending was. newlinechar  newlinechar again, the part about 'The problem there is that we aren't attempting to understand the nature of God, we're merely attempting to sort out the rules he supposedly imposed on us.' was a misunderstanding, drop that section of discussion (you switched 'we' from meaning religious people to people in general, or scientific people between sentences there, and I didn't catch it)

Thousands of people have been vanished by the CIA, only some of which we know about in Gitmo. Millions of Iraqis have died in a senseless war. Tens of thousands of our soldiers have had their tours extended far beyond their original signup, and those same troops subjected to depleted uranium poisoning, denied veteran benefits, and forced into war crimes. newlinechar  newlinechar But only a very few **Citizens** have directly had their liberties taken away, that's true... and of course, we're the only people that matter. Everyone else can go fuck themselves while **W** debts us all into pecuniary prison for the next century.

I click ads sometimes.

Dave Ramsey makes the point that all of this consumer lending has only been going on for about the last 30 years for credit cards and only about 60-80 years for mortgages.  People had mortgages before then but it was considered a black mark against their character.  Sears actually used to say it was 'FOLLY TO BUY ON CREDIT' in their catalogs.  Now, Sears actually makes more with their consumer finance division than they do selling actual merchandise.  James Cash Penny did not allow people to purchase things on credit from his company while he was alive.  Americans really need to wake up to this. newlinechar  newlinechar http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9050474362583451279 newlinechar  newlinechar and  newlinechar  newlinechar http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1828764955204524646 newlinechar  newlinechar Also, think about this, especially after watching the first video.  Think of all those credit card applications you get now.  If that it not the video proving it's point, I don't know what is.  Most of those cards are backed by fractional reserve banking.  So in effect when you use them to purchase merchandise, labor, etc. you are causing inflation and increasing the money supply.  In effect, destroying the value of the dollar and your savings.  Don't believe me, take a look at how many loaves of bread, gallons of milk or gas $10,000 in savings would have purchased even just 5 years ago and compare to now. Even worse, some people are now using the 12months zero percent balance transfer to extract money from the credit card and invest it in a savings account, borrowing from their home equity to invest, borrowing, borrowing, borrowing.  This allows the banks to loan or create even more money because the money ends up going into savings or checkings and into their reserves.  Sounds exactly like what was happening with stocks in the Great Depression all over again.  It is just happening with the banks instead of private investors doing it.    Think of that times the zillions of new credit cards approved each day.  RON PAUL 2008!  It is the only answer.  Someone like him comes along once in a blue moon.  He is smart and he has integrity.  He wants to stop spending and shrink government.  Restore faith in the US Dollar.  It has to start there.   newlinechar

Well, since my father teaches at a school district in Florida, I  tuned into the bit about the 'Florida Local Government Investment Pool' and googled up this Bloomberg article: newlinechar  newlinechar [Florida Halts Withdrawals From Local Investment Fund (Update3) ](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601170&amp;refer=home&amp;sid=aDdJ4GDZ6eao) newlinechar  newlinechar It seems to me to be an examination of one situation that is likely going on all over the place.  When school teachers have their paychecks held up due to the liquidity crisis you know the sh** is going to hit the fan politically. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a slow motion crash winding its way through the system as all these credit vehicles get marked down.

when there was nothing there was no time. time began with the universe. If you have self-consciousness  you already have a self, a consciousness  and the division between two.

my point was, in languages that don't guarantee tail call optimisation (either in the spec, the way scheme does, or de facto by having the single implementation be the 'spec'), you have to actually write your code differently. it may be a behind the scenes detail in terms of interpreter/compiler implementation, but it obtrudes itself upon the user's notice

I'll begin with an apology for taking what, in retrospect, does appear to be a condescending tone. It doesn't further debate and certainly wasn't my intention from the outset.   newlinechar    newlinechar I'll address the point of contention concerning Iraq's post-war situation first. I'm afraid I would have to disagree in the strongest possible terms that it is 'difficult to say the invasion has made things worse'. Which is no mean feat considering the state of the country following ten years of sanctions, effectively crippling the country socially and economically. I'm not sure how it would be possible to conclude that life for the average Iraqi citizen was improved by the invasion. The human cost in the post-invasion years is perhaps the most damning aspect. I'm sure you're aware of the Hopkins studies, the latest of which in October 2006 suggesting a figure for deaths attributable to violence ranging between 426,369 and 793,663. In addition to the direct loss of life the effect on social infrastructure has be devastating. The limited social programs that were in place before the war became unsustainable. Right through to January 2007 electricity generation had fallen below pre-war levels. The majority of the country still lacks sanitation, 32% of the population have access to clean drinking water, 19% have access to a sewage system. There is a national shortage of food, 25% are totally dependent on emergency rations. I don't think it would be unreasonable to suggest a large percentage of the population will be forced to forgo a formal education. In Baghdad 75% of children no longer attend school, following the invasion over half Iraq's schools were declared in need of rebuilding, literacy levels are now lower among 15 year olds than 35 year olds.   newlinechar    newlinechar Moving on to the sociological effects on Iraqi society. Preceding the war, Iraq was one of, if not the only secular society in the region. The majority of Iraqis identified nationally and not along religious lines. The result of the infrastructural breakdown, outlined in the previous paragraph, and creation of a power vacuum has formented the sectarian conflict that has engulfed Iraq. Which leads into my claim that the invasion of Iraq has 'increased terrorism and nuclear proliferation worldwide'. I can't claim credit for this statement though as I'm essentially paraphrasing the CIA and practically every other intelligence agency, specialist/committee on international affairs in the world. The reasons for the increase are fairly straightforward. Partly for revenge, in the case of low-level terrorism, but on the issue of international terrorism and proliferation it is a question of self-defense. I fear this is getting a little long winded but I'll be happy to elaborate on that.   newlinechar    newlinechar For me the tangible costs of the 'just war' type intervention that took place in Iraq are insurmountable when offset against the potential benefits. To move on to my second point and return somewhat to my suggestion that the US has acted contrary to preventing human rights abuses, there are dozens of questionable examples but I'll begin with one close the previous topic. Saddam was eventually convicted for the crimes he committed in 1982, accurately so. Coincidently 1982 was the year Iraq was dropped from the list of states supporting terrorism. And support continued right through 87 and 88 when he was gassing the Kurds, perhaps 100,000, but the US didn't object. The administration at the time actually successfully blocked congressional efforts to even protest Iraq's use of chemical weapons against civilians let alone take action.   newlinechar    newlinechar This sort of selective recognition wasn't what I was really alluding to though. To get a true grasp of the inaction and active contempt for humanitarian concerns the US has shown in its foreign policy you have to look toward its record at the UN. The US leads every nation by far in its use of the veto, for starters it's easy to show that until recently the US has blocked every Middle East peace proposal thats been forwarded. There is comprehensive evidence of inaction on the United States behalf in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Declassified State Department documents show that the US applied diplomatic pressure at the UN to discourage intervention during the peak of the attrocities.   newlinechar    newlinechar Another example that is often described as an altruistic intervention is the deployment of troops to Somalia during the famine in 1992. What isn't mentioned is that the US was the chief supporter of the Somali Warlord Said Barre from 1978 through to 1990, While he destroyed the country and slaughtered around fifty thousand people. When the proxy regime collapsed in 91' the US simply pulled out and the country descended into civil war. The US still refrained from acting as the famine and fighting reached its peak in the first half of 1992. However elections rolled around in November and suddenly troops were deployed, unfortunately the famine was almost over by this time and the troops probably did more harm than good. Its actually possibly the troop deployment re-escalated the violence, US government reports suggesting 6,000 to 10,000 casualties. The point is there was a much better alternative. The bombing of Kosovo in 1999 is another example of intervening to exacerbate the problem. Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Haiti, East Timor a plethora of SE Asian countries. There really are a wealth of cases.    newlinechar    newlinechar Let me know if you require sources for anything I've claimed above.

Thats an interesting position to hold, because it is the logic used by the neocons and anyone else that wants to shape other communities in their image. Your assumption is that Pakistan can't be trusted to respect the power of a nuclear weapon, while the USA can. Why should the they assume we can control ourselves, when we accuse them of not controlling themselves?
Holy fucking humble batman.  That thing is amazing.
Is there actually any evidence out there that Iran was ever even pursuing nukes?  I've never seen any aside from purported 'intelligence reports', which by themselves aren't evidence of anything.
interesting. and better yet, you have geographical targeting. good point. i'll have to try it sometime. hahaha
Governments are notorious for changing requirements mid-stream.  Product developed by third party is not quite what they had in mind, so gov reworks requirements.

I realize its manifestly unpopular.  I hated this book with a passion when I read it in high school.  I couldn't understand why anyone would want to read such a dry, dusty piece of literature.  Then, in college, I took a course of independent study where a professor picked all of my books and the first one on the list was The Scarlet Letter.  Upon re-reading it, outside of the hellish confines of high school, I personally found the book to be fascinating.  The prose is quite good, if you can get past the articulation of the time period.  Also, the way Hawthorne writes the book, something will happen in the story that was based on some passing mention of fact earlier in the story, so that the ending sequences are perfectly crafted.  You get the impression at the end that no author could have achieved that particular emotional exchange between the characters at the book's end.  Pick it up the next time you're at a book store and read three pages.  If it wasn't taught in high school English class, people would think its a cool book.  
This seems to be common when the user has no expectations. I wish you had been in a confortable environment with a baby sitter to guide you experience, it could have been the complete opposite experience had it been approached in the right light.

No, no, no. You don't understand. This how Scientology *works*. They never defend or explain *themselves*. They don't pick the attacks which are *accurate*. They pick the ones which *transfer attention*, the ones which raise eyebrows, which force the attacked party to turn around and defend themself in turn. Once this is done, suddenly the spotlight has shifted and the *other* guy is red-faced and the original attack on Scientology has been successfully defused. Calling the proposal 'incomprehensible' does just this: it diverts all attention to the proposal rather than Scientology. This is an explicit part of the way the COS operates: 'Always attack, never defend.' It's subtle, and you have to be able to recognise it.

Here's my problem with the whole 'God did it' thing. Even if you do allow that to answer your questions about science, it still opens up hundreds of new questions about God and his motivations, nature and capability which are unanswered either by science or by religious text. newlinechar  newlinechar Is God infinite? If the universe is finite, where does God keep the rest of himself? Is he three-dimensional? Four? Can he travel through time? Can he travel back in time to see his past self? If so, what happens to the timeline? If not, why not? If God is an infinite presence, in what sense is he present in the real world? Does he give off heat? Does he interact with ordinary matter in a manner which can be tested for? Has he mass? Does he have an electric charge, or is he electrically neutral? Why'd he create the universe in the first place? Did he create other intelligent life forms on other planets? Why did he start out with one legal system and then replace it with another one, instead of starting out with the working one from minute one? Why create humans at all? At what point in their evolution did humans acquire souls, and why do humans have them but not animals? Are we even sure about that? Why are humans created in need of redemption when they could have just been happy forever? Why let the Fall happen? Why does God need praising? Why is prayer necessary if God already knows what you want and what you need better than you do? If he is good and omnipotent, why is there evil? Is he partially evil or limited in his powers? If the answer is 'free will', why is freedom to do evil better than eternal happiness? And why were humans built without free will? Doesn't that mean they were built imperfect? And so on, and so on...

No on-chip cache (L1 or L2) today is DRAM.  DRAM is still largely incompatible with high-performance CMOS used for making processors.  The reason cache hasn't scaled as much as the rest of processor 'power' (speed, bit-width, etc.) is that bigger caches get slower (relative to the processor speed) thereby ceasing to be effective caches.

If you do, make sure you get the right OS. newlinechar  newlinechar tzk replied with: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Where can I find a 32bit only CPU... that's new. newlinechar  newlinechar The implication (and it was fairly obvious) was that it's no longer possible to buy new 32 bit CPUs.  If we follow your reasoning about 32 bit OS only on 32 bit CPU and 64 bit OS only on 64 bit CPU, then noone from here on will be able to run 32 bit Windows. newlinechar  newlinechar While you did not actually type '32 bit CPU' in your original post, it was clear from your words that you intended that anyone who wanted to run a 32 bit OS needs to buy a 32 bit CPU.  tzk pointed out that is no longer feasible. newlinechar

Beware: Internet Tough Guy
I worked briefly for my high school district after I graduated, building some of their first computer lab networks.  (The very first I did while I was student) newlinechar  newlinechar A significant part of our project was halted for _6_ weeks during the summer because their electricians were never available.  I harassed the administration about it almost daily, and they acted like it was completely out of their hands.  It's basically an environment where nobody is accountable for anything.  Everybody's jobs are indefinitely secure until America collapses and they behave accordingly. newlinechar  newlinechar I was being paid on an overall contract basis, not hourly, so I basically absorbed the cost in wasted time.  When the electricians finally showed up, they gave no notice.  If I weren't there, they probably would have just left or screwed it up.  But for the most part I was still just a kid, so the experience was worth a lot more than the money.

SBCL is faster than Strongtalk and its dynamically typed, for example. Besides the current Strongtalk implementation is buggy and incomplete (for example, there's no auto GC trigger, so unless you GC manually you just run out of heap.) newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with Smalltalk, Python and Ruby in general is that because _every_ call is a dynamic message send, there are fewer opportunities for static analysis. Runtime-driven optimizations only get you so far, and come with a hefty price: startup and 'warmup' time. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure having so much dynamism in the language is actually beneficial. Dynamic typing is great, but being able to make guarantees to the compiler is just as important.

Compliance can be bought by purchasing credits from countries that have exceeded their reduction targets.  That's how the protocol ensures that *global* emissions are reduced.

Actually it is. The modern usage of the word is inaccurate. A monopoly is a state grant that guarantees that a service must be provided through a certain source.

It's unlikely that it uses reflection any more than the rest of the runtime. The JVM isn't bad for dynamic code generation and loading.

You read articles about American kids 'growing up so fast,' but I think the opposite is true.  The persistent sheltering and excessive scheduling of kids is extending childhood at least through college, if not further. newlinechar  newlinechar If teenagers really were adults, they wouldn't have any problem with the 'my roof, my rules' attitude of their parents.  I mean, when an adult stays at someone's house as a guest, don't they adapt to the household's customs? newlinechar  newlinechar The poster that started all this makes a valid point--a lot of quarrelsome teenagers claim they should be 'treated more like adults,' when in fact what they really want is the benefits of adulthood with none of the costs. newlinechar  newlinechar I my opinion, it's not parents that make being a teenager suck, it's high school.  For some reason American's think it's a good idea  to stick 2,000 teenagers in a building with less than 200 adults to supervise them.  What you end up with is a micro-society *defined by children*.

Sorry but I was personally in those hearings when Victoria Toensing stated flatly that Plame was not covert. She was a drafter of the secrecies act. (Oh man the DEM's in the room went crazy).

There is no more court case, no more investigations for trial, nothing. It's over. Nobody is going after Armatage who was the actual leaker. Why isn't he being put on trial? Why isn't anyone at all being put on trial, or even charged for that matter? All you have now is DEM's in congress screaming about 'we need more documentation from the White House'. It's crap. The whole thing. If the White house coughs up more emails then pow! DEM's will find some other scandal to yell about. That's DC politics. They pontificate and make make assertions via questions like 'shouldn't the public have a right to know'?. Party line editorialists pick it up and make a public case and people who hate Bush scream about treason and betrayal. Everybody sites tons of 'proof' to make their case and then DC moves on to the next scandal.

That's in a parallel universe.
I appreciate the well thought out response. newlinechar  newlinechar I cannot deny that the US has made a variety of mistakes in foreign policy with its attempts at *real politik*.  Many times, the US tried to choose the best of two horrible options (which is sometimes necessary). newlinechar  newlinechar I'd be interested to see sources for the Somalian and the Rwanada assertions as I had not heard those. newlinechar  newlinechar As far as Middle East peace, you will most likely disagree, but the UN is not exactly unbiased.  I have contempt for the organization's inaction, and frankly I also have contempt for the massive scandals that the organization has been involved in with tyrants and dictators, as well as the power given to power-hungry nations to overrule humanitarian efforts (the US included) and the voice given to other tyrants, dictatorships, and regimes actively violating human rights conventions.  No governing body can be taken seriously under such conditions, especially when no 'advanced' nation condemns such idiocies other than the US and a few others. newlinechar  newlinechar Given that, any Middle East peace agreement by the UN needs to be taken with a grain of salt.  Israel has made mistakes, but the UN passes more resolutions against Israel than *any nation on Earth.*  We can argue whether Israel has done some horrible things and deserves it, but there are *much much much* worse regimes that are ignored, and even given speaking time, in the General Assembly.  When the UN treats Israel and Palestine equally, I'll take it more seriously.  Until it condemns Palestinian terrorist activity and human rights violations with the same passion as its virulently anti-semitic members condemn Israel, I will ignore it. newlinechar  newlinechar My altruistic examples were South Korea and Bosnia, and I haven't seen any rebuttal to them.  I am not challenging them, but I appreciate your responses. newlinechar  newlinechar I think its up for debate, obviously, but my opinion is that the US has done more good for the world than bad.  Many people disagree with that and you may be one of them, but no country can be perfect.  We had to choose to ally with Stalin in WW2 because it was arguably the lesser of two evils.  Sometimes the real world dictates those decisions, and many times we make the wrong decisions or self-serving decision.  But I think the US is one of the only, if not the only, nation that has the *ability* to engage in altruistic interventions that *does* engage in them, even if all of them are not.

&gt; we just have a good idea that lots more CO2 is a bad thing in the long run. newlinechar  newlinechar So its not solid research, but a good idea. Does the co2 sink occur in the oceans, in the terrestrial plants or both?  newlinechar  newlinechar Seems like the questions haven't been fully answered for us to be going off half cocked. There have been occasions where we have made things worse for local ecosystems by messing with the natural order of things (e.g. pesticides). So to me the logical course of action is to focus on fuel efficiency before throwing money at the issue of global warming. The fuel efficiency will benefit us immediately and the warmer issue we don't know what if any benefit will be achieved.

_We simply cannot afford to lock up every felon for life._ newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, if we decided to decriminalize drug use, we'd have __plenty__ of prison space to lock up all felons for life. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, it could well be argued that we've completely over-built the prison system in the first place.  I think even if you factor out the drug-related offenses, we're still imprisoning people at a much higher rate per-capita than any other western country. newlinechar  newlinechar _If we crucify every governor who makes a parole or pardon decision that turns out badly in hindsight, we're going to discourage any exercise of discretion in this field. The result won't be that the criminal justice system just keeps everybody locked up forever; rather, the result will be that the system will be administered by unaccountable, faceless board members with no aspirations to electoral office._ newlinechar  newlinechar I definitely agree. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know if Huckabee has done this, but talking forthrightly about the parole incident, and what he's learned from it (from all different angles), I think would help a lot.

You shouldn't assume people are staking a claim on your land, but you also shouldn't assume people aren't staking a claim on your land.  newlinechar  newlinechar Your right I don't know these people. They did the 'Good American Thing', that is they paid their taxes and kept up their fences(maybe? cause if they did how did they not know their land was being used for 20 plus years, how did they not see the paths.) From what I am assuming these people did very little on this land other than a day or twos work every couple of years.  People still need to protect their own land and their property(don't assume violence please, simple communication does this) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now I know the Kirlins kept their fences up, but it was not mentioned in the article that Mclean and Stevens jumped a small fence. There was also not a no trespassing sign posted(I just reread it to make sure).   newlinechar  newlinechar As far as your last comment goes, I don't think you understand the law.  If the landowner says, 'you can use my land, or you can't use my land. Then this law is voided, individuals can't squat when there has been some type of intervention.  When no intervention is made for long periods of time, then you run into a situation like this.   newlinechar  newlinechar There is something said about knowing your neighbors.

&gt; You may be aware that 'revenge' is reactive. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, but it has no goal unlike most other holy wars. I don't think any terrorist believes that they are converting people. It is 'eye for an eye', nothing more. Pretty soon we'll all be blind.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You are not taking Islamic Radicals seriously because you ignore half the things they say (all of the parts about infidels, hating Jews, stoning women who go into public without a male family member, Caliphates, 12th Imams, etc) newlinechar  newlinechar I ignore this because I hear the exact same things from Christians regularly. A guy was stoned to death in England this year, though not for religious reasons. There are many preachers in the US that think women should be subservient. The problem is that we give the islamic retards airtime. It would be the same as allowing the head of the KKK to speak for Christianity.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; They have attacked or attempted to attack many Western nations, not just the US.  newlinechar  newlinechar Only ones that have directly attacked them. The July 7th London bombings were the UKs first ever Islamic attacks, meanwhile the Glasgow airport attack was Scotland's first ever terrorist attack in our entire history going back to the stone age. newlinechar  newlinechar They also attack Russia, largely for their actions in places like Afghanistan and Spain for being involved in Iraq (like the UK). newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand I could list off a hundred countries that they don't attack. Most of these countries have the same religion and core beliefs as the UK and the USA, only an imbecile would believe 'they hate freedom' as a rationale.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The US just happens to be the most powerful and is easy to focus newlinechar  newlinechar Have you even looked at the list on the wiki page? If I was from any one of these countries I'd hate America too. You replaced benevolent democratically elected leaders with megalomaniacal despotic dictators purely for your own strategic or ideological needs. These 'leaders' have killed millions over the decades. If you grew up knowing that your father was killed in a US-led coup, would you not be angry? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I challenge you to prove that :) newlinechar  newlinechar Have you ever even read about the crusades? The sacking of Constantinople? I've never read anything as brutal as that from Islamic history. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You may be aware that the Crusades were a delayed response to Islamic aggression. newlinechar  newlinechar Really? Or Islamic *expansion* through *conversion*. Big difference, though I admit I may be wrong in this respect, it's far from my specialist subject.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I am not sure where you get the idea that I am anti-Islamic  newlinechar  newlinechar Quote: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; &gt; Believe it or not, Islamicists (not all Muslims, only the extreme ones) have been slaughtering infidels for centuries.  newlinechar  newlinechar Your use of 'infidels' as a derogatory term kind-of gives it away.

No, they are not silenced. But they should not be taken seriously until they put down the dogma and think objectively. The reason ID is derided so much is that it is utter moronic and calling it science is an insult to science.  newlinechar  newlinechar Science is about as far from closed as you can get. The fundamental point of the subject is to learn and the only way to do that is to allow yourself to change opinions based on observable evidence. There hasn't been any against Darwinian evolution however there has been almost infinite new evidence that continually backs up the theory. For example, DNA and the heritory process in general wasn't even fully agreed upon in Darwin's time.  newlinechar  newlinechar Science isn't a belief system. Changing your opinions on things doesn't affect whether you get eternal salvation or eternal damnation. Scientists do not have the same investment in their beliefs that ID'ers have.

If he lent his car knowing that a robbery was going to take place, it makes him an accomplise. However, the punishment should match the actions.

Where is the justice in that? newlinechar  newlinechar If they had filled up with gas, and said they were going to commit a robbery in a joking fashion and the attendant thought it was a joke, does the gas attendent get life because 'no gas, no murder' since he did technically 'know' the gas was going to be used in a robbery?

My philosophy is thus: newlinechar  newlinechar If I don't want to see a story in my recommended tab because it doesn't interest me or whatever, I downvote it. If it's an interesting story, and then I like it, I'll upvote it so that reddit figures out to give me more like that. newlinechar  newlinechar If there was a 'Quality' upmod/downmod and a 'Taste' upmod/downmod, this wouldn't be an issue-- I'd automatically leave RP stories as neutral in the quality department-- not having read them-- but automatically downmod them in the 'Taste' department, because they don't interest me and I get sick of seeing them. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider the fact that people may have DIFFERENT REASONS than you for downmodding or upmodding stories, and mine is the recommended tab.

Actually, until I read it I was of the opinion that it was just a study group, one of those gestural resolutions that congressmen can wave at  specific groups of constituents to show they are doing something. After reading it I am not so sure, this is a group that is empowered to range freely through all of the law enforcement agencies of the United States, require their cooperation and look towards _potential_ motivating factors for things that are already crimes.  newlinechar  newlinechar But with the added fillip that the actual rules of organizing the committee staff are the ones used when creating an interagency task force that is intended to coordinate law enforcement activity, not just study it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Why are you so freaked out in support of it anyways? It's a badly written law that looks much too much like a commission created to draft a framework for creating a class of political crimes and drafting legal policies that would make that class of crimes (prior to any violent action) a cause for arrest and detention.

But at some point, cyclical universes or not, we're going to hit a brick wall - that's god. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't consider this belief to be intelligent design which is generally defined as 'kind-of evolution but with intelligent help (on earth) at various points along the way'. I am an advocate of evolutionary theory, not ID. newlinechar  newlinechar Intelligent design as its defined is a pretty unsophisticated wannabe theory.

&gt; If a God exists, those who argue for ID do argue under this assumption, then he caused evolution. newlinechar  newlinechar Those who actually devised and 'contribute' to ID, e.g. fellows of the Discovery Institute including Behe, insist the intelligent agent is not necessarily god.  ID was conceived specifically to sneak creationism into US public schools, which requires it not be religious.  If ID necessarily required god, it would not be allowed in schools.  So more savvy ID promoters will tell you the intelligent designer could be an alien.  But that's just a flimsy smoke screen for god.   newlinechar  newlinechar Check out the links to the pbs documentary and to the pandasthumb.org for critical reviews of ID.

Specifically, NIST's interim report on 7 World Trade Center displays photographs of the southwest façade of the building that show it to have significant damage. The report also highlights a 10-story gash in the center of the south façade, toward the bottom, extending approximately a quarter of the way into the interior. newlinechar  newlinechar http://wtc.nist.gov/progress_report_june04/appendixl.pdf newlinechar  newlinechar There are fires on several floors.

What she really stands for is not so important as what she can talk about in order to get elected.

Depending on the person, I would have no reason to think something that serious would be nothing but a joke. Even when sober. It is ridiculous to think that if they do happen to carry out what I had thought they were joking about, and it resulted in a death, that I should be punished for it for nothing more than letting who I thought was a friend go pick up some food or something to that effect when jokingly saying he is going to rob a house on the way out the door.  newlinechar  newlinechar Once again, the rest of the world 'gets it' but the US doesn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is one of those older laws that violates civil liberties more now than ever before.

I applaud him whole-heartedly in this.  newlinechar  newlinechar I do have to wonder, though, how effectively the things he said there will be twisted by the Right to discredit him in the eyes of the electorate. Unions? WPA? Trade restrictions? I can see Faux News going apeshit on those issues, and I can see the rest of MSM painting him as some kind of throwback to the depression era Leftists. I wish I wasn't so pessimistic about this, but the last few years haven't really inspired me with confidence that he'll be given anything close to a 'fair and balanced' hearing on these issues.

Yes, I work for Reddit, which is owned by CondeNet, which has a commercial relationship with Facebook.  However, that wouldn't change my opinion, and I thought it was common knowledge and didn't need to be explained. newlinechar  newlinechar What you are missing is that the Facebook PR people do not know how to explain to the unwashed masses what Javascript is and how it works with Beacon, and how it is the other site owner's fault that they did not respect their own users' privacy.  I don't blame them, since clearly most of the developers don't get it either. newlinechar  newlinechar Here is how the beacon works:  The site owner includes some javascript from Facebook, which sends them a bunch of data, including your cookie.  This is clearly explained in the developer docs.  Now, the naive site owner simply includes this javascript on every page rendering (like Hotwire).  newlinechar  newlinechar The right way to do Beacon would be to ask your users if they want this on, and THEN include the javascript only after they had opted in on the 3rd party site.  This is how Reddit was going to do it.  You would have had to check a box in your preferences before we ever even include the javascript, because we understand how Javascript works and how if we included it every time, then Facebook would get a lot of data that you don't want them to have.
I read this whole string of comments just to make sure someone made that point about Pot Mom. If anything, she's *more* responsible for her daughter's death than Holle, given that she had to know that storing and dealing drugs in her home would create an ever-present danger.

The joke, which originated from a website called santabanta.com, was: What is the difference between a Sardar (Sikh) and a donkey?

I can't believe you would think they are in the right. What proof did the judge show that he had been maintaining and using the land non-stop for 22 years? Also, do you really think the fact that he has connections to the city played no part in his bogus claim? newlinechar  newlinechar To me, if you are paying property taxes on a lot that you own, and walking by and maintaining the land, you own it. So, they bought the land, hoping to build a house on it, but they couldn't afford to develop it and because of this, this somehow allows other people to claim they own it. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, what would have been the case if someone had purchased this lot a month prior to this, would the judge still have a 'claim' on the property?

I hate Clinton and am supporting Obama, but I can't believe how many people upmodded you for saying this. Saying that Clinton is the same as Bush does a disservice to the things that are *actually* bad about Hillary. It also reinforces the problems that were so prevalent in the 2000 election. Would anyone today actually say that Bush and Gore are the same? newlinechar  newlinechar Clinton is not a religious nut. Clinton will not try to appoint people who don't believe in birth control to head up sex ed in public schools. Neither will she try to pass a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Clinton will lift the ban on stem cell research. Clinton will protect the abortion rights of minors. Clinton will add sexual orientation to the definition of a hate crime. Clinton will ratify Kyoto. Clinton will close Guantanomo. newlinechar  newlinechar It might not be a Department of Peace, but these are real, tangible differences that will directly benefit people in this country. She may not be even close to the ideal president, but she is *nothing near* Bush.

&gt;I believe that the dominoes were 'divinely' set in motion at some point before the big bang if that's how you want to put it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Thats something that many people believe, but I cannot see it being much different than intelligent design. At superficial levels there is difference in that technically it doesn't need id concepts such as 'irreducible complexity'. newlinechar  newlinechar The evolutionary theory says we are explained by an unthinking process which progressed with no goal in mind. When you have God stacking divine dominoes before the Big Bang this is no longer true.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example, the reason that almost everyone has back-problems is easily explained by the fact we evolved from species that walked on all fours, an action which places less stress on our spinal cord. However the evolutionary advantages of walking upright were just big enough to offset the disadvantages of back problems. This explanation doesn't really work that well if you have God 'stacking dominoes', because all of a sudden you're left with the question 'Why did God 'stack the dominoes' in a such a way as to leave us with bodies that are so easily susceptible to back problems' and also 'Why did he create our bodies so that the most obvious and logically sound explanation of back problems requires his non-existence'. Any answer you come up with becomes really cumbersome, and the clean evolutionary explanation doesn't work any longer because that explanation requires that there was no intelligent input into the design of our bodies, whether we were designed ahead of the Big Bang, 15 billion years ago, or whether we were guided into our present form over the ages.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Intelligent design as its defined is a pretty unsophisticated wannabe theory. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree. The ways in which intelligent design is wrong are very subtle - its not creationism with its blatant idiotic claims of the world being only 6000 years old.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But at some point, cyclical universes or not, we're going to hit a brick wall - that's god. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Even if thats true (and it doesn't have to be true), it most likely won't be any of the Gods from the any of the religions on Earth.

Well, to be fair, when we talk about 'The CIA' it's like saying 'Americans do this' or 'The Government did that'. It's a gross oversimplification. The truth is the CIA is full of factions, double-agents and disagreements, just like the government.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's really not fair to say 'The government did 9/11.' It's much more accurate to say 'Treasonous elements within the CIA, the US Government and the private sector were responsible for 9/11.'

But your website was still there and under your control, right? newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, I think you were well within your rights to issue the takedown and that authors *should* have recourse against infringers. newlinechar  newlinechar But I think that the use of terms like 'steal', 'recover', and 'theft' is symptomatic of a major and widespread problem with people's perception of copyright in the modern world. If I steal your car, you no longer have a car. This is a clear and obvious negative impact on you. If I 'steal' your 'intellectual property' (another problematic term), you still *have* what I stole. There may be a negative impact, but that impact does not result from the deprivation of property. newlinechar  newlinechar If somebody copies your content without permission and attains a higher spot on Google than you, you might rightly claim that they have 'stolen' your traffic. But to say that they 'stole' your content carries unwarranted connotations.

Consider that reloading the analysis results from disk and _verifying_ that all of them still apply may be slower than just redoing the analysis. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar What you describe as recording runtime info and annotating the AST is commonly known as Feedback Directed Optimization (FDO). But it works better on the RTL, not on the AST. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Go one step further and record branch or path information and you get straightening of hot paths, too. The next step is to do all of this at runtime by detecting hot paths and you get a JIT trace compiler. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar IMHO a trace compiler is the best approach for compiling a dynamically typed language. So that's what I'm working on right now for LuaJIT 2.x. Stay tuned. newlinechar  newlinechar

'Endless war' is rhetoric, and valueless. Conceded. Likewise, 'bottomless pit' is an extension, with no factual basis. newlinechar  newlinechar But... 'some people agree'? Some people agree that Bush should be lynched, that doesn't make them *right*. 'some see it as getting better'? Who are these people, and what do they base their viewpoint on? Do they live in Iraq? Is their primary job to sift through military reports? If they're just a TV pundit or average schmuck, then I don't give a shit what they think because it means nothing. My great grandma thought that blacks shouldn't be allowed to go to the same school as her kids, and she wasn't alone... but luckily an idea being *popular* doesn't make it *true* or *right*. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if you could perhaps tell me the viewpoints held by soldiers in Iraq, or Iraqi citizens, who think that things are 'getting better', it'll hold some weight. Not much weight, because I've seen a lot of viewpoints from informed people about how it is the same or worse; one opposing viewpoint would have to be **very** informed and well written, with extensive evidence given, for me to believe it. But I am open to the possibility that things are no longer getting even more hellish in Iraq... of course, it's hellish enough as it is, so that would be small comfort to those living there. newlinechar  newlinechar A small mountain of evidence has piled up that indicate that Iraq is far worse off since we came: newlinechar  newlinechar * Iraq veteran suicides and PTSS. newlinechar * Evidence of torture and illegal detention. newlinechar * Soaring per-capita murder rates. newlinechar * Vastly increased tribal tension/civil war. newlinechar * War profiteering/mercenary abuses. newlinechar * Vast war debt. newlinechar  newlinechar *Extraordinarily* worse. These aren't just talking points or blurbs spouted by a talking head... all the items listed above are proven facts that can be independently researched and verified. Any opposing viewpoint will need to provide a similarly broad and comprehensive mound of evidence to the contrary for me to believe it. newlinechar  newlinechar So you see, it's not that we don't know other viewpoints exist... it's that we don't view them with the same respect we hold for viewpoints that have *facts* to back them up.
&gt; The biggest problem with parents is that because they learned that the issues they dealt with as teens were basically inconsequential, they fail to be empathic enough that the teen feels they are taken seriously. newlinechar  newlinechar That is true.

&gt; &gt; Science isn't a belief system. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Of course it is. It is faith in the Scientific Method as a methodology to knowledge. newlinechar  newlinechar I cannot agree with that. That's like saying 'the sky is blue' is a belief.  newlinechar  newlinechar Show me a single doubt in 'The Scientific Method' and I'll maybe agree. The process itself is factual, not based on belief. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; For example, let's take global warming researchers. Those researching climate change that are getting funding from the government or private enterprise have to find evidence of climate change to keep their funding! newlinechar  newlinechar That's corruption and unethical. Part of the standard scientific method is to 'check sources' and that also includes the character and integrity of the source.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If Darwinism was proven to be false or major holes were found in it, a lot of researchers and the foundations of their research would disappear... a life's work for many. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, we should just give up all science then? newlinechar  newlinechar If that's your reason for doubting Darwinism then I doubt your reason. Entire branches of science have been rendered irrelevant by later advances. We still revere the original authors as they made their theories to the best of the knowledge of the time.  newlinechar  newlinechar If compelling evidence came along to suggest Darwinism was false, any scientists that remained in that camp would be ridiculed. This is why we ridicule people who believe in ID.

&gt; Ya know, part of the problem with parent/teenager relationships is that both sides are unwarrantedly arrogant and less than empathetic. newlinechar  newlinechar That's not really true. Parents are, for the most part, certainly empathetic to their kids' needs, for the simple reason that they truly love them. Anyone who has children understands this; parental love is, without a doubt, the purest, most potent form  of love that the human mind is capable of. newlinechar  newlinechar And I don't think that teenagers aren't empathetic to their parents, either. They're just doing what they're genetically programmed to do at adolescence: break away from the family group and try to form their own path.
I think you are on to something here. The perfect machine version of this would use a perfectly thin band with no force required to bend it and no stretch.  newlinechar  newlinechar A thin metal band will not be strong and a thick metal band will require a lot of force to wrap it around the rollers.

Exactly. Banks could make riskier loans and still earn a profit (or so they thought). This resulted in an increase in the number of people who could qualify for loans. A good number of these people couldn't actually afford the loans they received, but the banks didn't care. newlinechar  newlinechar An increase in buyers results in an increase in prices due to competition. Where previously someone making $70k a year could buy a house at $250k, now he/she has to outbid someone making $40k/yr who's willing to take out an ARM. newlinechar  newlinechar Eventually, one of two things will happen: banks will realize that they are losing money to people who can't afford their mortgages, or homebuyers will become smarter and realize that ARMs are horribly expensive. As usually happens, human stupidity beats out human intelligence, so we're seeing the former. Banks grossly overestimated how much profit they could make on subprimes, which is why you can't get one anymore. newlinechar  newlinechar This means that there's no longer a $40k/yr buyer that you need to outbid. There never should have been in the first place. That was the artificial foundation.

The Day God Was Born:  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Long ago, primitive people lived in caves. They had few rules and no religion. The operative social principle was 'might makes right.' The biggest and strongest men got first crack at the women and the food, and they slept closest to the fire. The small and weak got food scraps and slept in the cold dank areas of the cave. The biggest and strongest men feared only one thing, the thing that everyone in the cave feared: thunder. When thunder occurred, EVERYONE rushed to the back of the cave, even the big and the strong.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar After thousands of generations, a small man was born who was slightly smarter (due to mutation) than his cave mates. He had the ability to notice correlations between events better than other cave people. He began to notice that every time thunder happened, certain other things happened shortly before. For example, the wind began to blow harder, the temperature outside grew colder, the sky grew dark, and the birds stopped flying around.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar One day, when he noticed these signs beginning, he stood up in the front of the cave and announced, 'From now on, I get first crack at the women, the food, and the fire!' All of the big, strong men laughed at him. Then, the small man said, 'If you do not give me what I demand, my friend Thunder will come here and chase you all to the back of the cave!' Again the big men laughed. Then, the thunder came and everyone ran in terror to the back of the cave. From then on, the small man who could talk to Thunder got whatever he wanted. And that was the day God was born.

However, if you assume evolutionists are all godless then why bother quoting the Bible in the first place? newlinechar  newlinechar It is quite obvious that many parts of the Bible, and in particular Genesis, are intended to be allogories.  Genesis is filled with logical contradictions - God creates man in Chapter 1 and then creates him again in Chapter 2; Cain is protected from other people even though there shouldn't be any other people to worry about; Noah's boat is no where close to large enough to fufill the role is described.  Until I meet someone who thinks sacrificing a dove is the best way to get rid of mildew or that one can't sit in the same seat that a girl on her period sat on - - until I meet that person I won't believe anyone takes the Bible litterally.

Both place the origin of civilized man between the Tigris and Euphrates.  Both say that the Earth was created first, then came plants, fish and insects, followed by land animals, and finally mankind.  Even the anchient Hebrews were smart enough to observe that fish obviously came before mammals. newlinechar  newlinechar Jesus never talked about the Earth being laughably young, but he did spend an awful amount of time talking about not judging others and pointing out the hypocracy of religious leaders.  Meanwhile, too many Christians spend their time telling other groups they are hellbound and blindly following their neo-con masters as they lead this country into social and economic ruin.

Also marked by notions that the entire Passion story (which has its own festivals outside of the proper Easter service) is anti-Semitic (though, most presentations that have been offered throughout my life have blamed humanity, rather than Jewish people).
Huh?  I'm not talking about an atomic bomb or 600lbs of C-4 exploding.  A box full of aresol cans overheating is going to sound like a land mine going off and not send a single scrap of debris flying.  Who knows what was in that building.  
ummm, it is
Not at all.  This man had already been locked up because he'd raped.  His victim, according to the article, eventually managed to reach Huckabee to say newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 'I told [Huckabee]: If you ever let him out, he's going to do it again,' she said in an interview.  newlinechar  newlinechar This isn't about people being justly or unjustly scared of convicted criminals.  My comment was alluding to the fact that Huckabee most certainly could have 'anticipated' Dumond would attack again.

Bright's implementation *is* the sole specification for the language as of 1.0: there is no substitute or alternative. It, or at least, the frontend, serves as the definitive guide to the semantics/syntax of D (which is why I assume GDC is just 'DMD frontend + GCC backend,' since it can then fully keep up with the language specs until an official doc has been released.)
no, 'Debunkers' love 'Depeacetime' cause nobody attacks them. Bunkers naturally hate artillery. newlinechar  newlinechar 
Credit reporting agencies are completely out of control, so it's nice to see someone finally holding them accountable for a change. newlinechar  newlinechar They seem to have been getting worse lately, if anything. That new free credit report dot com commercial (which is actually for a pay subscription service from Experian)--the one with the guy stuck with a crappy job in a fish restaurant because of ID theft--seems to be verging on extortion. They're pretty much just saying, 'Nice credit history you got there. It'd be a shame if something happened to it.'  newlinechar  newlinechar $2.7M is just a drop in the bucket, but maybe if this judgement encourages others to sue for their damages, it might just start to add up.

I was following Reddit's own [suggestion](http://reddit.com/help/reddiquette): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;[Don't] conduct polls using posts. If you feel you must use Reddit to conduct a poll do it using a comment. Create a self referencing post and then add a comment for readers to mod up or down based on their answer to your poll question. Also, be sure to indicate in the title of your post that the polls is being conducted using comments. Including something like '(use comments to vote)' in the title would probably be sufficient.

We have heard nothing but saber-rattling against Iran for various things, but the President has railed against the threat of Iranian nuclear weapons as the biggest reason to attack Tehran if they didn't stop.

Maybe they're not serving those ads to me anymore - which makes my initial advice even more relevant.  Click dem granny boobies!
The real problem with the DMCA is that people don't know how to file a counter-notification. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If someone issues a DMCA take-down notice, a US-based ISP is legally required to take down the content. If the victim of the take-down notice files a counter-notification, the ISP is then legally required to put the content back up, and if the filer of the notice wants to continue, they have a limited period of time to file a lawsuit. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The DMCA sucks for a whole heap of reasons, but there are far more effective tools of censorship out there today.

I'm aware of how feminists are viewed, which is the reason for the wry edit.

I don't think it's that simple, but I agree with your sentiment. The dynamics in this industry are very complicated, and finding a solution won't be easy. But it's high time we recognize that the current regime is not producing results. The rules have to be changed. The pharmas will probably remain profit driven, but I could see radical changes occurring elsewhere in insurance, managers, etc. The incentive structure needs change. Perhaps the first step is giving users real bargaining power, because currently, if you're lucky enough to be included in the system (you have a job and are not sick), you still don't have any power.
The only logical reaction to such debate tactics is to punch the person in the face. newlinechar  newlinechar You know what might be an improvement to our current farcical election methods? newlinechar  newlinechar A [Chess boxing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_boxing) tournament.

I don't think there's much argument about the readability here. Even if it only takes you 10 seconds to mentally decode the meaning of the point-free definition, that's still 10 seconds extra compared to the immediately obvious lambda definition. And the point-free definition doesn't seem to offer any special benefits in this case.
&gt; this is the only real use of an empty regex. newlinechar  newlinechar Not really. // is not magical when used as the first argument to split(), but is otherwise. An empty regex defaults to the last successfully executed regexp. I have to admit though that it can be very confusing, and haven't really seen it being used outside deliberate obfuscation and golfing.
That's what I suspect as well.
I really believe we need shorter term limits, for all positions in the House and the Sentate.  The career politician needs to know that if he or she is doing a bad job that they won't be able to delay a change in their behavior because they won't be voted out in years, but that they face expulsion within mere months.  Every three months, the voters are asked who they approve of and who they don't.  Members of Congress receiving a majority 'NO' will face challengers in new elections the coming May or November, whichever arrives first. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You would see an immediate drop in the control lobbyists have over what is supposed to be public service.
Ah, here comes another tough and strong stop-whining-get-over-it guy. 'Life's a bitch, so I'm gonna be a bitch and you should too.'
The wipe Israel off the map is a deliberate mistranslation (that is a lie). I’m no fan of religious nutcase Ahmadinejad and I will dance an Irish jig when he’s out of power, but neocons are deliberately mistranslating his statement, lying to the American people, in order to start a war with Iran. Ahmadinejad was quoting (actually slightly misquoting) Khomeini.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar For more information on what Ahmadinejad and what it meant read: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-sedaei/the-biggest-lie-told-to-t_b_70248.html?load=1&amp;page=2 newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The fact is that Ahmadinejad has little power in Iran. He does NOT command the Iranian military as presidents of the United States do. The real power in Iran is in the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Iran and has the final word in all aspects of foreign and domestic policies. Ahmadinejad is largely a figure head.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

Those competing with Kucinich will do their darnedest to discredit him, and there is plenty to dish about (the man is human), but that is neither a reason for Kucinich to change course nor an opposition that Kucinich cannot face down.  I don't doubt that he'll continue to receive biased and nonsensical attacks, but he gives as good as he gets.  He stands his own in the debates, and he doesn't shy away or waffle.  When lame-ass TV personalities try to trivialize him or his wife, he politely but firmly calls their behavior unprofessional and talks about meaningful issues.  Kucinich has the one thing that Americans have been wanting and needing: a backbone.  
Not when he's captaining his blimp, he's not. Take that you prolifigate spenders of other folks money!
Teaching children falsehoods and corrupting their education with a bastardization of science doesn't help them survive. newlinechar  newlinechar It is not the job of schools in a democratic society to indoctrinate children in the propaganda of the ruling party.

[NPR held a radio debate today](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16843353) in Iowa for the Democrats.  I haven't listened to it (the audio is not available online yet) but I'm willing to bet that the format is quite different from the TV news networks.
Actually, I believe you keep karma from deleted posts. I didn't delete it out of respect to the 50+ people who have posted comments.

Your point is correct.  Posting things like this to a forum of like-minded people *will* actively spread the hate.  I have nothing against that as a tactic, because it demonstrably works.  If anything, I advocate doing that *instead* of emailing the company, because companies don't really get the full picture from direct customer contact.  They get it from market trends.

On the same line, you can make the same argument against the civil rights movement and followers of Dr. King or Gandhi.

&gt; If 100,000,000 want to establish a Caliphate and slaughter infidels, you might want to take them seriously. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, you can turn on your TV right now to see people in the US who want to 'turn the middle east into a parking lot' and deport all non-residents. No difference really, it's the same attitude.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I wasn't aware that 50 Swiss tourists in 1997 were responsible for attacking Islam? newlinechar  newlinechar Their nationality had nothing to do whatsoever with that crime. There could have been martians at the site and they would have been executed as well.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; They (radical Muslims) hate the West and others because we meddle, but also because of what our values are.  newlinechar  newlinechar They may *hate* us for values, but they sure as hell aren't trying to kill us over them. Killing their parents/children on the other hand... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Ignoring 100,000,000 people that are actively attacking infidels is ignorant and dangerous. You still are not taking them seriously. newlinechar  newlinechar Once again, I did not need to take them seriously until Mr Blair dragged my country (Scotland) into the middle east. Can you not see cause and effect here? We had no problem with Islam and Islam had no problem with us. Instead they are now driving flaming cars into airports. newlinechar  newlinechar My issue with the 'hate freedom' gambit is that there are countries more free than the US and the UK without any Islamic threats or even comment.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I've read a lot about the Crusades, and I am surprised you would cite them without knowing of the massacres on both sides. newlinechar  newlinechar Reading material for later, thanks for the links. I was much too busy today to do your post justice.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Infidels are merely individuals who don't believe in the Prophet, etc. It wasn't derogatory, it was accurate, and it wasn't meant in a derogatory manner. newlinechar  newlinechar OK, I guess I took it the wrong way. To me it's like the Japanese word 'Gajin'. In a text book it'll likely say 'foreigner' but in reality it means 'foreign devil' or 'barbarian'. I have always assumed infidels was pretty much the same thing and had an undercurrent of insult behind it. 
Duh. I can't believe how many people took this seriously. This place is scarier than I thought.

I've been using it in production for a few weeks in a University department for internal IT support and software development. newlinechar  newlinechar So far I have found it to be very good and fast. I've found a couple of rough edges, but nothing major. A couple of things that it has going for it over trac are multiple project support, and built-in support for multiple repository sites (i.e. no need for plugins if you use something other than Subversion). newlinechar  newlinechar I've found it nice and feature-full and easily and extensively configurable. Also, my non-technical users have found it very easy to use to raise issues and the like. newlinechar  newlinechar To sum up, the major features that I like: newlinechar  newlinechar * Many useful modules: Issue tracking, repository browser, wiki, forums, document and file storage. newlinechar * Multiple projects in the one instance newlinechar * Ability to turn on and off modules and issue types on a per-project basis newlinechar * Configurable workflows and permissions newlinechar * Editiable issue types. newlinechar * Easy-to-use web based configuration.
Yeah.  The confounding thing is that it's common in Mexican culture to feel that saying something negative to a stranger is taboo.  So when you ask directions, the person will be happy to tell you where to go if he/she knows.  Unfortunately, if he/she doesn't know, rather than disappointing you by saying, 'no se' they will invent directions and send you off on a wild goose chase.
From GPL2 section 3 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such  an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) newlinechar  newlinechar If they took a base xubuntu disk and added a few packages and changed the configuration slightly, I think they would be in the clear, because xubuntu does include instructions for obtaining the source. Since they were making it available as a free download, it is a noncommercial distribution. I think they're covered. newlinechar  newlinechar It's an edge case, but from what I saw the supposed Ubuntu developer didn't really do his homework and may have opened himself up for doing a false claim under the DMCA. newlinechar  newlinechar And even if the GPL was violated (which has not been demonstrated) you are supposed to be a copyright holder to file a takedown notice. And again, the person who sent the notice probably isn't. newlinechar  newlinechar I really hope this doesn't backfire on the guy.

No.  Look up the reelection rates of incumbents.  It's not a red herring it's an easily verifiable FACT.   newlinechar  newlinechar When seats change, it's almost always because someone voluntarily gives the seat up.  Someone with as much power as a President isn't likely to do that. newlinechar  newlinechar The 'tide of congress changing' is usually just a few seats, out of hundreds, switching from one party to another.  We're usually close to a 50/50 split, so it doesn't take much. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm actually pretty astounded someone would try to imply that reelection rates for incumbents are anything but extraordinary.  I'll assume you aren't an American. newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt;The LAW is the LAW that existed before time began. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That's not helpful when talking to an atheist.  It assumes a central authority that has not been proven, only asserted.  Truth by assertion is automatically questioned.  If we can't test it, then we won't accept it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;As to whether God would strive to clarify the changes, I think he did. In every word that comes out of Jesus' mouth in the text that remains to us. No one who reads what he 'alledgely' said can deny the wisdom of it. Faked? Shopped? We as a race reset our calender on this man. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, that didn't happen until *long* after his alleged birth, and that by fiat by religious officials.  There's a reason it's referred to as the Gregorian calendar, and another why not every culture on earth follows it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar However, Jesus' words did nothing to clarify which laws are still in effect, and which have been laid aside.  In fact, there are no clarifications on homosexuality, shellfish or disobedient children at all.  Your reference in Acts comes *after* his alleged return to Heaven. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Is there wisdom in the Bible?  Sure, just as there's wisdom in the Koran, and the teachings of the Buddha and just about every other religion on Earth.  Most religions include guidelines on practical social controls so everybody learns to get along.  It's the supernatural claims that atheists reject, because they can only ever be taken on faith without any proof beyond what's written in your preferred holy text. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Most of the wisdom to be found in these texts has be considered in terms of the society it was originally written for.  Relevance changes as society changes.  Atheists are fond of discussing the barter and treatment of slaves (i.e. I have two daughters that would bring me a very nice profit were I to sell them into slavery as Biblical law allows), but that's no longer appropriate today.  Homosexuality is another favorite, because modern medicine and hygiene means that the old reasons for prohibiting it are no longer valid.  Each and every value asserted by the Bible has to come under scrutiny rather than accepted blindly, but most religious believers are content to simply let their leaders tell them what's appropriate and what isn't.  That's why we have Pope Benedict XVI, Pat Robertson and Fred Phelps all trying to decide for their flock and condemning anyone who disagrees. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Do I have to consider the hypothesis?  Absolutely.  Just because people have used the wrong methods to arrive at a conclusion doesn't invalidate it, it simply means we need to find an alternate way to explore their conclusions.  The problem is that none of the data we've come up with fit those conclusions, so more and more we're having to reject those claims.  This is why I believe science can never reconcile with religion, because religion's purpose is to fill in the gaps where science hasn't yet come up with an answer.  As science answers more questions, religion has fewer gaps to fill and loses more of its power.  Thus we have the remarkable backlash by the religious communities that we're observing today, hoping to discredit science and restore the rule of religion over our lives. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar For my part, I will fight against that backlash and remind people of the need for critical thinking.
I think what he is saying is that creationist don't reject data entirely.  They do form it to fit their pre-conceived beliefs as they process data, but don't reject it outright (you'd end up being completely blind, deaf, and hard of smelling). newlinechar  newlinechar I think that's what the 911 truthers do, to some extent, but it's not their fault.  We do have scientific consensus that evolution is true.  We really don't have any kind of consensus on 911 because everyone aboard every plane is dead, some evidence was destroyed, and the private efforts are so far incomplete. Only the federal government has both the means and the motive to do a comprehensive, conclusive study.  For seem reason, the fed doesn't seem that interested. newlinechar  newlinechar In this kind of environment, all kinds of mis-information is bound to spread.  I'm not even saying the truthers ARE wrong about everything, but it's not their fault.  It is human to try to make patterns out of incomplete data.  The government should be doing a better job of figuring out what really happened, then making decisions based on real, factual, cohesive, information.
Bush is far less complicated than people give him credit for. newlinechar  newlinechar Have you noticed that when Bush talks, you can kind of see Cheney's lips move and can never see his left hand?
Yes, I know that. But, how does it compare to assembler? Because that's basically the kind of expressiveness you get with the java language. I'm not knocking the speed of java, I'm knocking javac for doing nothing more than calculating a few constants, and dumping everything else onto the programmer. 
&gt;(Does it count as a denial if I am lying?) newlinechar  newlinechar Yes newlinechar 
Based on a lot of evidence, it's pretty clear that our federal government is highly corrupt.  I don't know if they are really that interested in the well-being of Israel, or if they just don't care at all about the well-being of America.

Would it be accurate, nmrk, to say you support DMCA because it gave you a quick, low-cost/hassle way to prevent infringement of your copyright?  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not a lawyer and haven't read the DMCA, but, I have some questions... newlinechar  newlinechar Did you consider going the small claims route? I know if you win in small claims it can result permanent injunctive relief, damages/court costs awarded to you (if you can show actual damages), and possibly some punitive damages awarded to you if the defendant broke the law. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think you need to a lawyer to file a small claims suit. And I don't know what the upper limit for small claims is where you live. [In the U.S. it varies by state from $1500 to $10,000.](http://law.freeadvice.com/resources/smallclaimscourts.htm) I'm wondering if you 'left money on the table' going the DMCA route. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I believe (not positive) the plaintiff can request a temporary court order to force the defendant to cease the alleged infringement while the case is pending. newlinechar  newlinechar What happens if this person puts up a copy of your website again?

Yes, dbus is one pick. The other one is bonobo, it seems.

&gt; Yes. It happens all the time. Right this very minute there are tens of thousands of intelligence agents and soldiers who are privy to all kinds of secret information that have not revealed it. newlinechar  newlinechar Keeping some kinds of secrets is a different beast altogether than keeping other secrets. newlinechar  newlinechar 'I was involved in a covert op to overthrow a foreign government' is not a secret that is nearly as provocative or guilt inducing as 'I ran a false flag op that killed 3000 of my own people and lead to two wars that lead to the deaths of thousands more.' Even if the former secret gets out, it's not horribly scandalous; we know it happens, whether for good or ill, and a significant (if misguided) segment of the population either outright advocates such behavior or tacitly approves of such. newlinechar  newlinechar The same can not be said for the latter; keeping a secret of that magnitude, beyond a very small handful of people, would be virtually impossible. One man, somewhere, will have an inducement to talk. Of the hundreds (possibly thousands) of people involved in a supposed 9-11 inside job, it's virtually unthinkable that every single last one of them is still on good terms with the Bush Administration or other shadowy quasigovernment; someone of the lot has been burned by a superior, disagrees with recent policy, has a financial problem that would compromise him, has grown a conscience and is willing to risk his life to expose the plot, is compromised and/or affiliated with a foreign intel agency, or fuck knows what else. You simply _can't_ keep a secret of that magnitude with a significantly large universe of people.

No, let's walk through this again. Given the circumstances, a copyright claim would be the most likely venue for getting relief in the courts and action from offending parties, yes, I am not disputing that. newlinechar  newlinechar What I am arguing is that, if you get down to brass tacks, the kind of issue you have with your cyber-doppelganger is actually exactly the kind of issue businesses have when other businesses misappropriate their trademarks. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's go through this in detail.  newlinechar  newlinechar You make some money by putting your writing and photography on the internet and running ads next to it. The guy who has been causing you problems has, according to your summary, done two distinct things: newlinechar (a) first, he has infringed your various copyrights and put up a wholesale duplicate of your website newlinechar (b) in addition, he has done such a tremendous job promoting 'his' website that, for example, it was showing up above yours in search results, with the consequence that a casual searcher might very well think *you* were the doppelganger, not that other guy. newlinechar  newlinechar Given the nature of your business, it's clearly (b) that all your real damages were flowing from, not (a); if this guy had made a complete mirror of your website that was impossible to find accidentally -- ie, that did not appear within the first several hundred google results obtained when searching on terms for which your website appears in the early results -- you would still be nominally 'wronged' by its existence, but very little. newlinechar  newlinechar A very clean analogy would be to a situation like this: a legitimate broadcast network broadcasts on channel 11; a pirate broadcaster has setup a device that immediately rebroadcasts the signal from channel 11 on channel 12 (not in use by any legit channels at the moment), with the exception that channel 11's ads are stripped out and instead channel 12 inserts its own paid advertisements, and similarly all station identifiers for channel 11 are stripped out and replaced with identifiers for channel 12. (this actually happens in the 3rd world!) The harm to channel 11 isn't coming directly from the signal-reception -&gt;rebroadcast, it's coming from lost advertising revenue  newlinechar  newlinechar In both your case and the case of our hypothetical channel 11 the most immediate remedy is to cut off the offending party's ability to infringe the materials, and if either you or them came to me for advice that's the advice I'd give.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, the specific nature of the harm you're suffering is sufficiently different from the standard harm victims of copyright infringement claim to suffer -- you are suffering loss of traffic and therefore advertising revenue, the typical victim is suffering loss of potential sales because potential customers can obtain the victim's works through other, more dubious sources -- that it doesn't seem at all similar, other than that in both cases copyrights are being ignored by the offending parties.  newlinechar  newlinechar The actual nature of the harm you suffered is, as stated above, much more along the lines of that suffered when trademarks are misappropriated, or along the lines of your identity being stolen, it just happens in this case that the act of misappropriation of ('trademark' or identity) involves heavy copyright infringement to perform, and thus attacking the infringement is the easy way to stop the problem from continuing. newlinechar  newlinechar I've gone into this point because your case brings up a somewhat philosophical nit I've been looking to pick for awhile: intellectual property, as such, is entirely created by statute and, consequently, the legal definitions of the various kinds of intellectual property are fairly detailed.  newlinechar  newlinechar However, just because the definitions are detailed doesn't mean that they actually are all that natural (in the same way that saying 'nonzero positive integers are either 1, multiples of 2, multiples of 3, or what ever is left over' is a detailed-ish description, but not necessarily *natural*).  newlinechar  newlinechar In your case, a lot of copyright infringement was necessary for you to be harmed, but I still contend the real harm is more along what trademark is supposed to protect (namely, it's supposed to protect your business venture from 'identity theft' like you suffered from). However, there's a good chance that you wouldn't be able to win a suit on pure trademark grounds, unless you lucked out and had a logo, etc. (look-and-feel cases are near-impossible). newlinechar  newlinechar This strikes me as an example of a big gap in our current set of intellectual property laws -- there's nothing in there that captures stuff that's not-really misappropriation of trademark, etc., but is still identity theft of some sort, including straight-up identity theft (which can be prosecuted as fraud, but still belongs to this category).  newlinechar  newlinechar For most concrete violations there's usually other things that can be used to seek redress (copyright violations, fraud claims, etc.), but I worry that some of those laws may be bent out of shape (or, as some other parts of the DMCA, have already been bent out of shape) to cover over the gap in the current spectrum of intellectual property laws (namely, the real gap of direct remedies for impersonation).  newlinechar  newlinechar So we're straight, I have no sympathy for your impersonator and am glad you were able to get your issue solved as quickly as you were; I am just using your story to bring up one of my concerns about the current regime (basically, certain fundamental 'intellectual crimes' have no direct codification in our intellectual property laws but are redressable via other aspects of the law, with the risk that those other branches will then run risk of distortion if they're doing double duty as the only remedy for the uncodified crimes, like impersonation).

&gt;What is your proposed solution to this? newlinechar  newlinechar I am not sure I have one. What I had to say was an observation, not just a piece of rhetoric for a sociopolitical agenda.  newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps the closest I could come to a proposed solution is simply a change in attitude. The first sentence I quoted pretty much tells the story. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;&gt; ...stereotype that you have to spend a ton of money to win over a woman newlinechar  newlinechar The built-in assumption is that it is a man's responsibility to 'win over' the woman.  newlinechar  newlinechar But this is only true because everyone believes it. There are no market conditions here. There is no scarcity. Men and women are present in our society in equal portions.  newlinechar  newlinechar Women have attained equal (or indeed greater) power in many aspects of life in our culture. But they have not yielded up their position as sole sexual gatekeepers.  newlinechar  newlinechar I admit I do not know precisely how this last can be made to happen. But I know that until it does happen, men will be unhappy with the status quo, resentful, inclined to post articles like this one, and to respond with a feeling of [white-hot rage](http://reddit.com/info/623wh/comments/c02lf9k) when confronting feminism. newlinechar  newlinechar This is the natural behaviour, you see, of people who perceive that they have been treated unfairly.

It sounds somewhat similar to what Mercurial does. newlinechar  newlinechar In Mercurial, first of all, history is immutable; while you can undo your latest commit using the rollback command, all of the earlier changesets are essentially there to stay forever. newlinechar  newlinechar Second of all, Mercurial changesets have an ID that depends on the content of the patches, the username, the date and time, the commit message, *and* the changeset's parent(s). This means that in order to apply a changeset to your tree, you must have all of the history that changeset depends on by way of its ID, which provides for pretty strong integrity (and it makes clean cherrypicking impossible; in Mercurial, a changeset needs to change its ID to be cherrypicked). newlinechar  newlinechar Merging is always explicit. If you pull in two changesets that are not each others parent or child, you will have to merge from their common base to an explicit merge revision (these are always revisions with two parents). To keep the complexity of merges under control, you cannot do merges of more than two branches (diverging changeset series); instead, you have to merge them two at a time. newlinechar  newlinechar To me, this sounds pretty similar to the kinds of things you describe here. newlinechar  newlinechar An example: the development of Mercurial itself mostly revolves around 4 branches, all in different locations. One, the 'main' branch, is the branch by the founding developer. This is basically similar to Subversion's trunk: the central development repository. In addition to this branch, he maintains a stable branch. This is similar to a release branch in Subversion in that it contains all the fixes to a release, but no new features. Bugfixes are always made on a stable branch and then merged back to the development branch. There is then a 'stream' of changesets that just make bugfixes, and this stream gets weaved together with another stream of new features/more complicated fixes, which moves toward a new release. newlinechar  newlinechar To remove the bottleneck of the single developer, there's a select group of about 8 developers who have push privileges to a 'crew' branch. This is on an entirely different server; these developers push their changes there, after which the main developer (and anyone else tracking development) pulls them into his development tree (these trees are similar most of the time, except that the main tree usually lags a bit). Then there's a crew-stable branch that does the same thing for crew as the stable branch for main; it's usually just pulled into stable. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to hear more, drop into #mercurial on freenode and ask around. From what you've described here, Mercurial seems like a pretty good fit.

Come on. Think about this for a sec people. Osama Bin Laden was a *former* CIA ally. He went on camera telling everybody it was Al Quaeda, except we now know it was Saudis (which Bin Laden was) on the plane. Then the U.S. military can't find Bin Laden- couldn't possibly be the CIA hiding him, like when they took a couple dozen of his family members back into the U.S. right after 9/11 for safety precautions. newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, does this not add up. Is it really that difficult to believe the CIA doing something evil and nefarious. **THAT'S ALL THE CIA DOES**.  newlinechar  newlinechar The Bush administration may not (and probably) wasn't in on it, but the neo-con machine wanted a war in Iraq and so they were going to get one. Bush was just another pawn in getting there.  newlinechar  newlinechar Cheney definitely knew more about what was going on, but I still doubt he knew what the CIA was up to. He's just glad a reason for a war was started and the military-industrial complex then used him to influence Bush in support of a war.  newlinechar  newlinechar The attack on 9/11 had CIA backing. It was done too smoothly (3 successful hijacked plans on 1 day). They weren't shot down and the towers fell way too quick. Even if you don't believe all that is enough to point to the CIA, you definitely have to concede that they're still on the table as a possibility.

I've got alot of gripes with JIRA. newlinechar  newlinechar If you've used it for awhile - particularly if you've had to support / customize the actual JIRA install, you'll quickly find yourself browsing through Atlassian's own (slow-ass) JIRA and finding that all the gripes and bugs you're discovering are mentioned, duped several times over the course of some years, and collecting dust. Atlassian doesn't appear able to use their own system effectively - that or they are seriously under-resourced. Their updates reflect the typical track of a mature and over-complicated Java app - spending so much time managing the ugly regressions and infrastructure problems in the beast that they've built that it becomes impossible to push through anything genuinely new or useful, or make the fundamental improvements which their customers request again and again.  newlinechar  newlinechar For a bug tracking system that goes for (and prices for) the 'enterprise' space, JIRA comes up incredibly short on everything you'd expect. It's 'time tracking' is appallingly crude and lame. It's lauded workflow processes are unnecessarily painful to administer and change. It's abilities to send updates via email etc aren't near as flexible and granular as they should be. It's web services API is anemic and hasn't been significantly beefed up since its initial implementation. The database schema has been designed by noobs. LDAP/AD integration is a hack and still requires setting up accounts for everyone in JIRA. 'Integration' with their wiki product Confluence, despite the fact that they sell this pairing hard, is pretty much non-existent, and you only need to look at public docs on said integration to realize just how shabby it really is.  newlinechar  newlinechar Trac is great, but won't cut it for our needs. FogBugz, same problem. Bugzilla sucks. Axosoft sucks. Despite the number of established players in this space, there is still *plenty* of room for someone who knows what the hell they are doing to dominate in the (wealthy) quarters where Trac+FogBugz are just a little too simple and one-size-fits-all.

The Bush Administration has been punishing Iran with economic sanctions getting the rest of the world to join in. Now we know that the administration knew Iran had stopped their weapons program back in 2003. I believe Bush and company were punishing Iran to get them pissed off enough to restart their program in order to give a reason for a war with Iran. Bush sent many naval vessels to the waters off the coast of Iran to conduct war games also in an attempt to lure them into doing something provocative. Bush and his people have been trying to get the American people to believe we need to attack Iran or risk a nuclear bomb from them. Now we know that the Bush Administration was lying and trying to start another war.

&gt;Iran is a signatory state of the NPT and has recently (as of 2006) resumed development of a uranium enrichment program. The Iranian government asserts that this enrichment program is part of its civilian nuclear energy program, which is permitted under Article IV of the NPT. However, Iran violated its NPT safeguards agreement by pursuing uranium enrichment in secret, after which the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution ordering Iran to suspend its enrichment-related activity.[25] The United States and some members of the European Union have accused Iran of using this program to help covertly develop nuclear weapons, which would be in violation of article II of the NPT. Iran remains under investigation by the International Atomic Energy Agency. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In November 2003 IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei reported that Iran had repeatedly and over an extended period failed to meet with its safeguards obligations, including by failing to declare its uranium enrichment program.[26] After nearly two years of diplomatic efforts led by France, Germany and the UK, in September 2005, the IAEA Board of Governors, acting under Article XII.C of the IAEA Statute, found that these failures constituted non-compliance with the IAEA safeguards agreement, not the NPT itself.[27] The United States contends on this basis that Iran violated Article II as well as Article III of the NPT.[28] However, the December 2007 National Intelligence Estimate judged, with 'high confidence,” that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003, with 'moderate confidence' that the program remained frozen, and with 'moderate-to-high confidence' that Iran 'is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons.'[29] newlinechar  newlinechar

How is that a sugar coated translation? newlinechar  newlinechar For example, every translation of Luke 12:47 shows Jesus as making a simple observation- where is one translation that shows that as a command? newlinechar  newlinechar Just to give your interpretation the benefit of the doubt, I assumed that all of the translations I checked are sugar-coated, so I went and made my own translation of the verse. The verb for 'beaten' is in the indicative mood. In Greek, a command or recommendation is given in the imperative mood 99% of the time, and in the Bible the indicative is used  in an imperative sense only when quoting the LXX, which this is not. But in any case, the mood is irrelavent. The voice of the verb is passive, not active, meaning that it applies to the person being beaten, not to the person doing the beating. So, if Jesus is making a command (which is *very* unlikely linguistically), it is a command to the slaves (to beat themselves I guess), not to the masters. So, if you are going to use linguistic criticism (and not just 'sugar-coated translations'), then your interpretation of this verse does not hold up. And it also does not hold up under literaty criticism: this is a parable. It is not about a master beating his slave- that is just an observation of the world made to get at another point. newlinechar  newlinechar If you are going to take a shot at the Bible, fine. But like I said, make it a good one- there are definitely enough of them out there. Don't just take a verse, read it wrongly and out of context, and them blame arguments to your interpretation on 'sugar-coated translations.'

Good point about the conspiracy and I agree therefore that it was a conspiracy of sorts, but that doesn't mean that Bush was involved in this conspiracy.

I didn't get the impression that he thought it was necessarily a bad song, just that the song created a popular impression of the band that wasn't really accurate. newlinechar  newlinechar The theory is certainly sound. Many artists have achieved fame with a hit that doesn't represent their catalog. They're left with the choice of changing who they are to appease the public or disappointing new fans and fading back into obscurity. newlinechar  newlinechar However I think he's really overstating the problem. The song's not *that* atypical. I doubt many people who got turned on to the band with Stairway were disappointed by the rest of their catalog.

I think this argument is based on the same general principle as the argument that switching from Windows to OS X will prevent you from getting viruses.

I am far more concerned with starving children than a tree.  My point is, however, that if we don't take significant steps to protect the environment, there will not -be- a world for human children to not starve in.  Obviously reforestation is only a facet of this and altering governmental policies is much more important.  This doesn't have anything to do with Al Gore.  Global climate shift is not only happening because he happens to be talking about it. newlinechar  newlinechar That's why I don't want to support Christian charities, actually.  Like you, they seem to think that what will happen in a few centuries is immaterial, and we have to directly help individuals now.  I happen to rather strongly feel that there's not going to be an Armageddon to make what we're doing to this planet irrelevant, and I would like to see humanity not threatened by the world itself. newlinechar  newlinechar I also horribly dislike the belief in the nonexistent that Christian charities generally work to instill in the people they're helping.  Too much of the world already has Faith that their problems will be solved because some cosmic force cares about them.  If you don't think you've got God to catch you, you've got to work to save yourself.  That is in my estimation a good thing.

There are a couple problems.  Here is the largest.  He is maintaining a hash in an array and resizing for every add or remove and with a very inefficient method of locating information. newlinechar  newlinechar A hash is a way of storing information to be referenced via some type of key.  For example, we might have a hash storing user objects for reddit users.  We could look your's up in the hash with the string 'aletoledo'.  This would return your object and we could do whatever we wanted. newlinechar  newlinechar A good hash stores the keys in a manner that allows rapid searching.  His implementation loops through all the keys until it finds what he wants.  How much longer would it take you to find a word in the dictionary, if they were put in there in no order?  You couldn't open it up and see 'f'.  I'm looking for cat, so let me go back to 'b'.  Too far, 'c'.  OK, now second letter...  The same thing happens here.  Much time wasted if you have to look at each word in a row to find what you want.  (This similarity is another reason why you might see a hash called a dictionary in certain languages.) newlinechar  newlinechar Next, a good hash stores data in such a way that adding and removing is fairly efficient.    This is done with advanced data structures based in linking to data.  You can look up linked lists to start and go from there to get an understanding of this.  The bottom line is that adding and removing should be fairly fast and other than sorting the key into the hash, independent of the size of the hash.  His implementation will keep getting slower with data added, because C# has to make an entire copy of the array when it resizes to add or remove and item.

I guess the difference between our viewpoints here is that I had been examining this issue in the context of running a distributed Erlang app across the instances. In this case you have already built your app to be resilient in the face of component failure, you are using mnesia to keep distributed state, and you are using a supervision tree that can deal with node failures. newlinechar  newlinechar If your non-Erlang app has been designed with a shared-nothing/stateless approach then you can gain similar benefits.  Systems boot up, copy what they need from S3 to local disk, run (with occasional checkpoints back to S3 for persistence), and when you no longer need the capacity you kill the instance. newlinechar  newlinechar

Your comment is re*volt*ing.
You are correct that it is also very academically popular. But this has less to do with features and more with the vocal advocation of some of them. Academics really like platform neutrality. A lot of tools are platform neutral, but are not that 'gospel' about it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Java advertised with features that appeal to  academics. Yet it actual popularity in the market place has everything to do with Java being manager-friendly. newlinechar  newlinechar One of the advantages of Java is that you can develop a program with programmers with a different level of skill, for example. newlinechar  newlinechar The experienced developper will design the architecture, including the interfaces for all required classes. The less experienced programmers just have to create implementations of those interfaces. newlinechar  newlinechar So the work is divided into small bite-size snacks, with one or few good programmers leading the overal design.  newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, maintainability. Say we want to add some feature to some class. We need not rewrite the whole app because it had a sane design. But the class that we need to change is complete mess, because it was written by somebody inexperienced (ie. somebody _cheap_). We just rewrite that little class now that it is going to play a bigger role in the overal app.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is the reason Java works well for a large part of corporate world.  newlinechar  newlinechar Not because it's a very good hammer. But it is a very _manageable_ hammer. As hammers come and go, it is likely the most sucky one still used today.

You have to remember that those immigrants have children.  They also tend to have children at much greater rates than natives.   You might find this interesting: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Immigration is clearly an important source of population growth in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, net international migration acounts for between 40 and 45 percent of annual growth in recent years. Researchers calculating the contribution of immigrants and their children to U.S. population growth over the past 30 years or so concluded that these 1st and 2nd generation residents accounted for about 55 percent of growth.

&gt;I don't see how you can even think such a thing.  newlinechar  newlinechar They are orthogonal. You can have a nation with corporate entities practically running the country themselves with no government interference. You can have one with companies kept at arms length from government, and little regulation. You can have one with a regulated market, and no corporations at all. Or you can have a regulated market, with strong  corporate influence on government. newlinechar  newlinechar Two separate issues. In fact, the very existence of corporate entities is government intervention in the economy. Individuals should be held civilly, criminally, as well as financially responsible for how their investment dollars are used. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Wrong again. Companies are pushed to create things that people will want to buy in successively greater numbers. Other companies, meanwhile, are pushed to compete with them. The driving force here is efficiency, and consumers have direct benefit because they can buy more for less. newlinechar  newlinechar Are people in 1st world democratic nations suffering from a lack of consumer buying power or product choice? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Companies benefit first by being free to seek profit in any way they want. newlinechar  newlinechar Which is the agenda behind this extremist economic position. Free to exploit workers however you please. Free to trash the environment. Free to foist harmful products on society with no regard to the long term effects.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The people benefit second by being offered a larger choice of products/services, at higher and higher quality and lower and lower prices through the forces of competition and natural selection.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is a typical talking point; but it doesn't match the reality of environments where there are few controls on the market, the disparity between rich and poor widens and you get a rich elite class and a poor underclass, for whom all that supposed economic freedom means very little. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Quality of life is not always related to freedom. You've never read any science fiction books? newlinechar  newlinechar Those same nations at the top of the HDI are also tops in areas of personal liberties and respect for human rights. Norway, England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan etc. aren't 'utopian dictatorships'. A civil society that cares about its members enough that allowing businesses to do what they please without regard to long-term consequences or the well-being of the population as a whole isn't acceptable economic policy, is one that shows demonstrable benefits according to objective criteria. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Ask yourself: Would you rather be free and poor, or rich and repressed? newlinechar  newlinechar False dilemma. The most rational course is to examine what works *in practice*, and implement those policies with ongoing examination of their effects; not blind adherence to an absolutist and extremist ideology.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'd rather have strong civil liberties and a government kept in check by the people, and a market where anyone with talent and ambition can excel, yet all people have their basic health, education, and shelter needs met: where those who fall on hard times are not reduced to starvation, but are instead given the help they need to become independent again. newlinechar  newlinechar A democratic nation, with its attendant legal and economic systems, exists for the benefit of all its citizens, not an elite few, be they nobility, bankers, or priesthood.  A nation with no opportunity for the (poor) majority of the population to have a say in economic policy is one that tends toward  oligarchy, in practice despite any official egalitarian label you put on it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There have, in fact, been many studies that conclude that libertarian theories would produce the most optimal results. Libertarianism does not exist in a vacuum. It is a thoroughly-researched topic. newlinechar  newlinechar Studies from right-wing thinktanks. How is this any different from Marxist-Leninists putting forward their own social-economic theories a century ago and insisting they had the One True Way? This is *theory*, wishful thinking, and ideological driven propaganda. For all practical purposes, it's a religious viewpoint, supported by faith, not objectivity or empiricism. newlinechar  newlinechar Did you read this? newlinechar http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?ref=world newlinechar  newlinechar

Scarborough hasn't been afraid to criticize as far back as I can remember.

While he obviously gives them the benefit of the doubt, he's more than happy to call out what he perceives as failures of execution, but the white house and the congress were very good at covering up incredible failures of execution for some time. As the chickens come home to roost though.... guys like Scarborough are turning on the people in power, though not the principles they espouse.
Quick explanation of what he's talking about, for the non-Cocoa programmers among us: newlinechar  newlinechar ---- newlinechar  newlinechar Autorelease pools are a sort of faux GC for apps that manage memory manually, using retain counts. (They date back to before Obj-C had GC, but you can still use them today, if you want to or don't want to risk breaking your app with the paradigm switch.) newlinechar  newlinechar If you didn't have autorelease or GC, you would create an object, then release it later, and anything that wants to hold on it will itself retain it, then release it later. This is one step up from malloc/free. newlinechar  newlinechar With autorelease, instead of releasing it, you can *autorelease* the object by adding it to the topmost autorelease pool (which is really easy: just send it the `autorelease` message, instead of the `release` message). newlinechar  newlinechar Every thread has one stack of pools, with no pools by default. When you create a pool, it's automatically pushed onto the stack. When you release the pool, it's automatically popped off the stack. (For obvious reasons, you can't autorelease an autorelease pool. But you can retain and release them.) When a pool gets popped, it releases all the objects inside it. (In a Cocoa app, the Application Kit creates one pool for you in the main thread, but you're not limited to that one pool.) newlinechar  newlinechar This works fine until you get into a tight loop (he mentions this in the article). For a large input set, your loop may accumulate enough used and discarded objects (which all pile up in that pool) to run out of real memory. Then you begin paging. This is the “blowing up memory” that the author is referring to. newlinechar  newlinechar There are three solutions. newlinechar  newlinechar The simple solution is simply to add more autorelease pools. For example, when iterating a collection of objects, your loop may create a pool, process no more than 1000 objects, then throw away the pool; the effect is that you process no more than 1000 objects per pool, and none of these objects make it up to your AppKit-provided pool. newlinechar  newlinechar The hard solution is to do no autoreleasing, ever—you do strict create/release programming, as if autorelease didn't exist. This is not always even possible, because some methods are only available with autorelease (`+[NSURL fileURLWithPath:]`, for example); more to the point, create/release code is harder to read than autorelease code because of the `release` messages sprinkled throughout your code. newlinechar  newlinechar The Leopard-only solution is GC. With GC, all the manual memory management (including `-retain`, `-release`, and `-autorelease`) becomes no-op; the garbage collector takes over completely. Unfortunately, if you already have an app written using autorelease, you would have to do a lot of testing to make sure that GC didn't introduce any memory leaks (more likely) or crashes (less likely). newlinechar

Many lawyers get rich representing corporations; many lawyers get rich suing corporations ([such as John Edwards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edwards#Legal_career)).  According to the American Bar Association, there were [over 1,100,000 lawyers practicing in America in 2006 (pdf)](http://www.abanet.org/marketresearch/lawyer_demographics_2006.pdf) and in 2000, 74% worked in private practice (presumably some for corporations), 8% in private industry, and 1% in legal aid/public defense.  Maybe it's just me, but the increase in litigation seems related to the rise of corporate power in this country. newlinechar  newlinechar Edwards has achieved impassioned legal wins for injured people.

Dennis Kucinich doesn't have this problem--he voted against the PATRIOT Act, voted against the Iraq war, voted against funding the Iraq war, voted against unfair trade agreements.  When Kucinich changes his stance (such as shifting from pro-life to pro-choice), [he explains how he got there](http://www.ontheissues.org/2004/Dennis_Kucinich_Abortion.htm); when Edwards changes his stance, he pretends he's always thought that way and ignores when others call him on it.

I definitely come from a libertarian perspective myself, but my moral foundation is based on natural rights and not economics and pragmatism (although I like economics as well). newlinechar  newlinechar You have a right as an individual to ensure your life and liberty from unscrupulous individuals and organizations. Either you do this retroactively though the courts, or proactively through regulations. newlinechar  newlinechar If the infringement on your rights causes’ death, then you cannot pursue any action in the courts, can you? So you have a right to protect your life proactively from organizations and individuals who would take it. It is not good enough to have to wait for an organization to kill or disfigure you, and then have your distraught family members report them to the Better Business Bureau. newlinechar  newlinechar We know that no matter what consumer protection organizations exist, that some businesses will harm your life. You have a natural right to stop them from doing this proactively through regulation and criminalization; it cannot all be left up to what is most profitable, aka, the market. newlinechar  newlinechar If you leave it up to the market, profit will find equilibrium which includes infringement on natural rights; it will not find equilibrium while excluding all infringement. In your model, killing people thus becomes a cost center to be managed and optimized, not eliminated. As long as the cost of harming someone is less than the revenue gained, then the business will pursue it. The market will not necessarily make the cost of significant infringement greater than the potential revenues.    newlinechar

No, it's not time consuming. It's a natural byproduct of buying from suppliers that just don't buy the mainstream stuff in the first place. The HFCS removal actually mostly happened by itself, because PCC buys from so many small suppliers that already cater to customers that care.

I do not think so. Even if people do not agree on the same thing, people can most certainly still get things done.

Ok, obviously not impossible, but it does try... newlinechar  newlinechar They probably cheat.  For example, I've heard you can steal focus if you attach your input queue to that of the foreground window, but that can lead to crashiness (of course if you think the user deserves to suffer for daring to stop paying attention to your application, you may not care).  I suppose just injecting code into the foreground process would work as well, if you have permissions for it.  There's also the obvious exploit of launching a new process whenever you want to gain focus.  (not really sure if these work) newlinechar  newlinechar Having neither access to the Windows' window managers' nor the offending applications' source code, I can't really know for sure how it's implemented.  But I do know from experience that Windows makes an effort to prevent focus theft.

Say there was a 'moral' movement to make all men who have premarital/homosexual/sodomy/whatever sex forced to do volunteer work to make up for that 'sin'.

It's all media. The 60's became the legendary time it is as a result of media hype and promotion. But, indisputably, it was a better time simply because government wasn't the goliath it is today.

&gt; Then began the fall of his country because no one was equipped with knowledge on how to sustain their agricultural industries, stability and the economy. This is significantly in part due to the racist apartheid newlinechar  newlinechar People in Zimbabwe are probably the best educated black people in all of Africa. Quote from Wikipedia: newlinechar &gt; Zimbabwe has an adult literacy rate of approximately 90%. This is amongst the highest in Africa. However, since 1995 the adult literacy rate of Zimbabwe has steadily decreased which is a trend shared by other African countries.  newlinechar  newlinechar Zimbabwe’s biggest problem probably came because the people were educated *too well*. In urban areas (where people are generally better educated), there were opposition newspapers. An opposition arose, and ZanuPF had a chance to lose an election (it is unheard of in Africa that the “liberation” party ever loses an election).   newlinechar  newlinechar This was the beginning of the sh*t in Zimbabwe. Mugabe then started to organize the farm invasions. The farms did not go to the best educated people to run the farms – the farms either went to government ministers or “war veterans”. The farmers or their workers (which actually had farming experience), were attacked and driven away. Agriculture formed the corner stone of Zimbabwe’s economy, and earned valuable foreign exchange – from there the collapse in Zim dollars.  newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar The collapse of Zimbabwe is squarely because of the Mugabe regime – for no other reason. Ian Smith saw the danger of Mugabe 30 years ago – that is why he tried to sideline him in favor of Abel Muzorewa.  newlinechar  newlinechar PS: Interesting fact – Mugabe is a lucky fellow.

Fair enough.  Why shouldn't college students be allowed to choose whether they vote in their college state rather than their home state?  They live in the college state 8.5+ months or perhaps more of the year.

agreed, but what is the cause of murder? Instead of putting a band-aid on the problem, we should truly fix things. newlinechar  newlinechar In the case of murder, it probably has something to do with money or love.

I think you've made a very smart choice.  You've now had 8 years of cash inflow equal to several thousand per year that you could have invested (and probably have).

I would like to share an e-mail with you that our President and COO wrote: newlinechar  newlinechar I very much appreciate the time you took to share your feelings with me.  What happened in this restaurant by one of our managers was absolutely unacceptable and we will not tolerate this ever happening again.

Well to be completely honest,  I personally think that being religious says a lot about your ability to come to sound conclusions when you believe in something as absurd and asinine as a man walking on water and coming back from the dead.  But that's just me personally, I don't like the idea that people truly believe in something because its in one book that has no facts to back it up besides this thing called 'faith.'  But since no atheist could ever be elected in America (not right now at least) and being atheist doesn't mean you are the best candidate I think RP is right, their record and character should be the basis of why we elect them.  I do not agree with Ron Paul's religious beliefs but I do agree with his message of freedom, liberty, and the Constitution.

Your experience? newlinechar  newlinechar I went looking for hard numbers on the subject just now (not for the first time), but couldn't find them in sufficient detail, much less all in one place.  I'd really appreciate it if anyone could provide such a thing.  From what little I did find, Ronald Reagan was very much an underdog against incumbent Ford at this point in the '76 election, and Ford in fact won more primaries than Reagan. newlinechar  newlinechar Apart from any of that, though, this race is unique in several important respects:   newlinechar  newlinechar  1. An overwhelming majority of americans oppose the current war, while all but one of the republican candidates support it.  All anti-war+republican voters therefore must concentrate their votes on that one candidate, while there are several pro-war candidates splitting the rest, with no clear front-runner. This may not matter that much to convention delegates and the GOP brass, especially if some of the current front-runners drop out and throw their support against Dr. Paul.  The party players would probably rather lose the election than win with a candidate who endangers their way of life.  But if he does well enough, they'd be killing the party to ignore the will of its members at large. newlinechar  2. Approval ratings of the republican president *and* the democratic houses of congress, are at *all-time* historical lows.  Many things contribute to this, but it is clearly a measure of dissatisfaction with the status quo. I would argue that candidates promising substanative and *specific* change are now favored by those paying attention, and will be increasingly favored by the population at large as time goes on. newlinechar  3. Polling methods have never been *less* representative of the general population, let alone people who are *actually* likely to vote in the primaries.  Many people have elucidated this point; if you have objections to it, please state them and I'll do my best to answer.

Sorry that it took a while to respond, been a busy week. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Don't forget that the possibility exists for someone to come up with a super-fast way to implement whatever algorithm you might use. As far as I'm concerned, N rounds of SHA-256 or Whirlpool is as good as bcrypt, scalable, and much easier to get right. Specifically, those algorithms are built into everyone's frameworks already. newlinechar  newlinechar The key issue here is not what algorithm to use, but how slow you can make it to check one possible password. Bcrypt is good as it has long initialization time, and that is needed for each try. So it is rather unlikely that there would be major advances on setup. newlinechar  newlinechar But the key point here is that you should use some cryptographic protocol when checking for password. Even simple N times SHA-256 (which as algorithm is just about as fast as SHA-1 BTW) is much better than single SHA-256+salt. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I don't disagree with you, except in salt being a 'band-aid'. A good design has 'layers' as you said yourself, and includes both a slow digest algorithm and salt, among other things. newlinechar  newlinechar That is where I disagree with you. newlinechar  newlinechar Nonce, or salt, is added to password or other data to prevent use precalculation (or rainbow) tables. And using any decent crypto protocol, especially with custom number or recursion, makes it very unlikely that attacker would have precalculated tables to match your setup. newlinechar  newlinechar And that is all that salt does, it prevents one type of attack that is more or less prevented already anyway. It does not add to security, as anyone who can access your password file or database can also get the salt value that was used. newlinechar  newlinechar So basically if we assume that other security measures have failed, and the attacker now has your users password file. There are two things that protect your users passwords. newlinechar  newlinechar 1. How strong passwords your users have used newlinechar  newlinechar 2. How long it takes to calculate single password hash newlinechar  newlinechar And that is where use of suitable crypto protocol and slow algorithm is crucial. Your attacker probably has a botnet at his disposal, either own or he buys calculation time from one. So he has the computational power of 10000  relatively modern PCs or so.  newlinechar  newlinechar Breaking any fast hash algorithm using hybrid dictionary attack (SHA-X, MD-X, etc) is doable for at least significant portion of those passwords. newlinechar  newlinechar But if you manage to slow things down 100-1000 times, you have pretty good chance of frustrating the attacker.   newlinechar

'Corporations are mandated by law to pursue profit.'  Wrong wrong wrong wrong.  
Let's see. Your first link, http://www.clasp.org/publications/marriage_brief3_annotated.pdf, includes such gems as: 'children raised by same sex parents are no more likely to exhibit poor outcomes than children raised by heterosexual parents ... children of gay or lesbian parents do not look different from their counterparts raised in heterosexual divorced families regarding school performance, behavior problems emotional problems, early pregnancy, or difficultities finding employment.' and 'There may be certain benefits to marriage, such as access to health insurance and tax advantages, that contribute to the increased likelihood of child well-being. In addition, it remains possible that those who marry also have attributes unmeasured in existing surveys—such as commitment, loyalty, and future orientation—that distinguish them from those who don’t marry and stay married. It is also possible that marriage itself—the actual act of getting married—changes the attitudes and behaviors of couples in positive ways, as well as those of others towards them.' newlinechar  newlinechar So your first source seems to say that though positive benefits are correlated with marriage, they are unable to establish causation (surprise surprise), because people with certain qualities may self-select toward stable marriage. Furthermore, children raised by same-sex couples already appear statistically similar to those raised by heterosexual couples; it follows then, that if you believe marriage is a positive force for the child, it would only be a benefit, not some sort of catastrophic failure of civilization. newlinechar  newlinechar Your second article is inaccessible; are you accessing it from somewhere with a subscription, or are you just throwing every article you can find at me, even if you can only provide an abstract? I doubt someone of your intellectual stature is writing from a library or university. newlinechar  newlinechar Your third article is inaccessible, but I'll quote a summary of their findings for you: 'Our findings suggest that children can potentially benefit from living with a cohabiting partner whose resources are shared with family members. Although children living with married rather than cohabiting parents fare better in terms of material well-being, this advantage is accounted for by race and ethnic group and parents' education.' Can you understand what your own research is saying? Marriage is an effect, not a cause. newlinechar  newlinechar Your fourth article is, again, inaccessible; I'm not driving to campus to do your research for you. I'll quote, again, from the abstract for you: '(1) family net wealth and total private transfers vary with family structure along three lines, marriage-remarriage, marriage-cohabitation, and male-female single parenthood; (2) marriage is a wealth-enhancing institution; (3) private transfers promote family net wealth; and (4) marriage reinforces the promoting effect of private transfers on family wealth.' In other words, marriage is an economic benefit (something no one denies, and which is actually one of the major arguments in favor of same-sex marriage). newlinechar  newlinechar In summary, though you claim 'Evidence shows that marriage is the best structure for raising children,' it's clear that there's no clear causative relationship between marriage and improved child welfare; rather, the correlative effects are confounded by the external variable problems of how ethnicity and socioeconomic status affect one's likelihood to marry and stay married. Allowing same-sex couples to marry, as should be their right as adult citizens, would merely extend the economic benefits of marriage to a relatively small additional portion of the population, and would, if anything, correlate with improved child welfare. Are you so blinded by bigotry that you can't read what your own research is telling you?
I agree with your general reasoning (no real idea about this instance either way), though I would say that race being a crucial to the question of whether or not, or on whom, to carry out the attack qualifies it also as sort of hate crime. newlinechar  newlinechar Still, even assuming this was no hate crime, it doesn't really tackle the *selective moral outrage* -- not to mention the compulsive framing of every other incident as hate crime --, now does it?

&gt;'Traditional' marriage (since you seem to deny there is such thing) has always been man and woman. newlinechar  newlinechar No it hasn't.

This guy is seriously overstating the situation. The people usually glance at your receipt and let you through without hesitation. They don't 'search' you by any stretch of the word.  newlinechar  newlinechar They simply look for huge immediately noticeable descrepancies (like you walked out of the store with 200+ products but your receipt shows you bought one item). If you buy a big product (like a huge TV) they will look at the receipt to make sure you bought it and didn't just pick it up on your way out (this is actually MORE trusting than other big item stores who require you to show your receipt to pick up your item to begin with). It's fast, it's painless, and doesn't bother me in the least.  newlinechar 
Don't attempt to use common sense, logic or rational arguments with that guy.  It will avail you nothing.
He is actually right there. newlinechar  newlinechar If you go the static way you don't need objects. Haskell has type classes, with is method overloading based on a datatype. Ehm, lets rephrase that: it means you define seperate implementations of functions where the compiler selects the correct one based upon the datastructures you use. newlinechar  newlinechar The only advantage of objects left would be object-identity. Which is easy enough to emulate, but actually has its purpose. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, OOP simply sucks at concurrency. You need either agents or referential transparity (read: declarative programming) newlinechar  newlinechar Nevertheless, the _success_ of OOP in the market place has to do with modularization.  newlinechar  newlinechar You can put buisniss logic concerning maintainability straight into the types in a  language like Java. This makes it a good language for a decent programmer that needs to lead a bunch of bad programmers. newlinechar  newlinechar But none of that modularisation has anything to do with OOP per se.

What I'm trying to say is that outer looks, whether it’s the clothes you where or the words you choose, is an important factor of how _everybody_ sees you.

Regexp is a misnomer, anymore.  The language of [arbitrarily-nested] balanced parentheses is provably non-regular, but as you point out, a pattern can be constructed to match it anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar Larry Wall: newlinechar &gt;Regular expressions' [...] are only marginally related to real regular expressions. Nevertheless, the term has grown with the capabilities of our pattern matching engines, so I'm not going to try to fight linguistic necessity here. I will, however, generally call them 'regexes' (or 'regexen', when I'm in an Anglo-Saxon mood). newlinechar  newlinechar Fair point, though, that these extensions to regular expressions enable the programmer to match non-regular languages.  I'm not entirely sure why one would choose that approach over writing a true recursive-descent parser, but it has a certain amount of nifty.

_Now_ you've found a valid response!
[Can't really do anything about it though :(](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forces_Japan#Today)
&gt;So given that you repeated the same argument over and over newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar No, I drew that argument from the research you presented. You presented your 'scientific facts' in the form of journal articles, and I pointed out how they were not stating at all what you apparently thought they were. You will now, of course, distance yourself from them in an effort to defend your original position. You can't have it both ways, either you trust a source or you don't - if you thought they were valid enough sources on which to base your frivolous argument before, then stand by them. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My own stance is that the effect on children or society is essentially irrelevant; barring people from rights others have is unjust. For historical analogies, it would be like preventing black men or women from voting simply because of the societal upheaval their suffrage might cause. Either someone is a full-fledged citizen or they aren't; currently, we are not treating homosexual people as citizens. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar However, I chose to meet your argument on its own merits. Again, from one of *your own articles*: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Our findings suggest that children can potentially benefit from living with a cohabiting partner whose resources are shared with family members. Although children living with married rather than cohabiting parents fare better in terms of material well-being, this advantage is accounted for by race and ethnic group and parents' education newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Your argument is groundless and your efforts to defend are intellectually deficient. You claim that I have yet to prove my thesis, when in fact I can cite my thesis almost word for word from your own sources.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar P.S. How is divorce relevant here? Would you ban that as well, in 'thinking of the children,' as clearly it would have a worse effect than them living in a stable same sex household. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar P.P.S. I'm not seeking to prove my own intellectual stature to you - I feel no need; I am merely mocking yours. When someone approaches a question with scholarly rigor instead of waving their hands and saying 'science proves it,' I treat them with respect. You, instead, began with platitudes such as 'marriage between a man and a woman is the best environment for a child' and then fruitlessly sought to defend that with evidence. This, combined with your overall inability to grasp the basics of rhetoric and construction of an argument, are what lead me to believe that you're most likely not writing from a university or library. Then again, I guess there's always Bob Jones University *et alii*. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

Agreed. Perl's design philosophy (and it *does* have one) is quite different to other languages. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it has been expressed well as 'Perl's learning curve isn't steep, but it is very long'. newlinechar  newlinechar i.e. You can be productive in perl quickly. But it also rewards deeper study. 'Easy things should be easy, difficult things should be possible'. newlinechar  newlinechar But this means it is possible for someone further up the learning curve to baffle a relative-beginner. Fortunately, the docs and community (perlmonks) are both very good.

&gt;I never said anything about romantic love, and frankly, polygamy is still 'man/woman.' Why is that so hard? Do you insist on [blah blah blah]... newlinechar  newlinechar What Huckabee said (and what you seem to be supporting) was no civilization has ever 'rewritten what marriage... means' and survived.  Right?  I gave numerous examples about how marriage has been rewritten.  In fact, changing the number of people involved in marriages seems like a pretty fundamental rewrite, doesn't it?  'No, that doesn't count because it's still *mostly* heterosexual!' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Well, I am familiar with the studies conducted trying to prove that there were gay marriages in medeival societies, and frankly, considering that 70-80% of Academics are left-leaning... my assumptions are not off-base. newlinechar  newlinechar What happened in 'medeival' societies isn't really relevant.  I wasn't really arguing that they had the modern concept of gay marriage in medieval times, just that the concept of marriage has undergone fundamental changes throughout history. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I apologize - they are my responses on this thread. I am the only one arguing against it here :). newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, the reason for that is you're wrong and everyone else is right. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It has everything to do with children and the role of marriage in our society. It is not specifically anti-same-sex marriage, but more pro-preserving our current definition of marriage. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Pro-preserving our current definition of marriage'?  Wow, that's a load of bullshit!  How about we concern ourselves with protecting people's rights instead of protecting the definitions of words. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Marriage is the best situation to raise a child in. newlinechar  newlinechar I definitely agree.  And since millions of gay couples are raising kids *right now*, we could improve those children's lives by allowing their parents to get married. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Men and women are also different in a host of ways, so in an optimal situation (and considering the research), having a biological mother and father in a married relationship is the best situation for a child to be in. newlinechar  newlinechar Okay, but, I can think of an infinite number of less than optimal situations for kids to be in, but I don't think the government should be in the business of deciding which situations are legally 'optimal', and which ones aren't.  Marriage should be available to any couple who wants it. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, lots of research says that the children of gay parents do just as well ass their straight-parented counterparts.  I also know some gay couples who would make truly awesome parents.  Who the fuck are you to say they shouldn't be encouraged to start a family? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That doesn't mean a same-sex couple is not 'second best' which I believe it is. I am more adamantly against single parenthood and angry divorces and out-of-wedlock births, frankly, because of their destructive nature on children. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, we can't outlaw any of those things, can we? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But the point remains: having a married mother and father is best. Expanding the current definition of marriage (since you barred the use of 'traditional' even though it is valid) to include more and more 'situations' muddies the waters and expands the situations children can be placed in, creating a host of new situations that are inferior for them to be brought up in. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't believe that's true.  Allowing gay marriage isn't going to make more people gay or lead to 'inferior' situations for kids.  It isn't going to create more gay households.  After all, it's already legal to be gay and raise kids, and millions of families are doing so.  All that's left to do is to give them the all legal protections that my wife and I take for granted. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That's all, really, and so if same-sex advocates could admit that scientifically and philosophically a married opposite-sex couple is better for children, I think I'd be more inclined to be sympathetic. newlinechar  newlinechar Why would they admit something that's not true?  And even if it were true, why is that enough reason to deny marriage rights?  If you saw a study that said white people made better parents than black people, would you support a ban on black marriage? newlinechar  newlinechar And explain to me one more thing: If gay marriage is wrong because it's not good for kids... how exactly is that so?  What are the specific negative effects of gay parenting?

That's about 6,000 kids.  Now kids have parents and many have a sibling or two who, unfortunately don't get a free meal.  So, again, just to make it easy, let's keep this at two additional mouths per kid to account for single parents/1 sibling or only 1 child with 2 parents.  Then that is 2 people that are most likely going to eat with the child that got the free meal.  say they spend on average $10.  thats safely $60,000 revenue (minus the 'at-cost' price of the free meal) for a measly $1,600 investment in addition to the 'awwww, McDonalds cares about our children' feel-good factor. newlinechar  newlinechar Corporations exist for one reason: to put money in the pockets of their shareholders.

There was a study done recently on the effects of legalizing hard drung use in the UK. They actually only criminalized it because of pressure from the US.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's a program where you have to be a current using addict. This is diagnosed by the doctor. The doctor then writes you a script for the ammount you are currently taking. You get clean drugs, regulated ammounts, in various forms. If you inject, you get clean needles, if you smoke it they can lace it into your favorite pack of cigarettes. You still pay for it, but since it's not illegal for you to have it, you get a higher quality product, and a safer product, at a lower price than the street market.  newlinechar  newlinechar It showed that when this program was in place crime rates dropped dramatically. It also showed that a good ammount of people voluntarilly weened themselves off whatever drug they were taking. They got their fun and then moved on.  newlinechar  newlinechar The stigma of being an addict in our society is so great, I feel it can be a detriment to those who may otherwise have just done it for a year or so and then dropped it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Granted not everyone in the study did so. Some remained addicts, but it was no longer affecting their health. Pure drugs, even hard drugs, aren't as damaging to the body as one may think. It's the additives and crap that gets put in them on the street that is so bad for you. They were able to hold jobs, repair their familiy lives, quit destructive behaviors like prostitution and gambling and stealing to get money for their next fix.  newlinechar  newlinechar Having the drug use in the open actually did seem to help the situation, not hurt it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'll try to find the source and link it here. But I'm in finals week for my grad degree so I'm a bit fried...it may take me a while. newlinechar  newlinechar edit: sorry, the harm reduction methods were used for heroin in Britain since 1920 and were reduced/eliminated in the 1970's.

A great Australian comic expressed why rape jokes don't work thusly: when you start making jokes about rape in a comedy club, the women in the audience start thinking about being raped, which (what a suprise) makes them less inclined to laugh, and also makes them hate the comedian for making them think about something horrible. The men who are there with the women then become angry at you as a comedian, for ruining the fun night they had planned. It's very hard for an audience to laugh at jokes when they hate the person delivering them.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In my comedy-watching experience rape jokes usually trade on shock value; they are also usually gay-rape jokes (as above), which trade on homophobia.

It's utter bullshit to think that these 'subprime' borrowers thought they could actually afford the houses they were picking up.  Everyone I know who used one of these mortgages was living in a Speculative dreamworld where house prices NEVER came down.  I personally know 2 people who have purchased multiple homes hoping to get rich.  They used ARMs to leverage as much of their assets as possible into real estate.  Meanwhile, I thought these people were crazy -- prices were completely unsupportable if looking at the fundamentals (such as local salaries).  If the government decides to bail out these folks, then I will be screwed twice: the market will not adjust, so I'll never be able to afford to buy my own home, and as a taxpayer I'll be on the hook for paying for the bailout.  Now, tell me, if I went to Las Vegas and gambled away a bunch of money on borrowed credit, would you be happy if the government made you pay my gambling debt?  Because that's EXACTLY what I think the government is asking taxpayers to do -- Pay for the speculative gamble of subprime borrowers.

In case you haven't been paying attention, there are a lot of people who see same-sex marriage as a terrible threat to traditional marriage.

my original comment is fact no matter what your delusions tell you
Oh, right. That's probably it.
Mutual tolerance for me means that only tolerant views are tolerated. Romney's speech reveals his views are not tolerant. Abstinence-only education, abortion bans, brainwashing children in schools are examples of intolerance and bigotry and aggression. Sharia law is an example of barbaric intolerance which is incompatible with human nature as I understand it. Etc etc etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Claiming this stuff has nothing to do with religion makes as much sense as claiming evolution is just a theory. There is a theory that religion is the culprit, and it is confirmed by millions of experiments. This makes it a scientific fact. newlinechar  newlinechar And I'm not talking about faith in general. Faith is not the same as religion. What I'm talking about are inconsistent and fossilized belief systems exploiting certain traits of human psychology and certain human instincts. These are systems which have built organizations around them, systems which have been beaten into people's heads since childhood, systems which do irreparable damage to their mental health, and which force people to live in constant denial of reality and common sense. And btw, this reality they are in denial of - this reality includes you and me. And I don't like it. When a driver on the road is in denial of reality, that's a usually a DWI, or at least reckless driving. When a president or a teacher in school is in denial of reality, I must be tolerant. newlinechar  newlinechar Btw, 'atheism' does not necessarily mean the opposite of such a belief system. In my life I've had enough of Marxism-Leninism which in Soviet interpretation became a bona fide religion exactly of the kind I hate. newlinechar  newlinechar Being tolerant to these religions is *dangerous.* I can turn my other cheek and you can, but for society it means disaster. It means cessation of any progress and regression to stone age. And there is no overgeneralization here. When a person steals or kills, you lock him up. You don't say 'it would be an overgeneralization to claim he could kill again'. When people from another country start mass killings of your people, it's not an overgeneralization to call it a war and to defend yourself. When people of certain beliefs become detrimental to the society, it is not an overgeneralization to call these beliefs *wrong,* to denounce them, and to prevent these people from affecting the society. And that's what should be done. newlinechar  newlinechar I wouldn't call myself an atheist, though I'm also not an agnostic in the popular meaning of 'bible could be right'. I don't believe a deity could exist, but even if I would admit the possibility, I would never accept the worship-me fag-hating deity. I see where this stuff is coming from and it is not Heavens.

A basic principle in linguistics is that you can tell a language's geographic region of origin by looking for the area where there are the most closely related variants spread over the smallest distance.  In the case of English, if you didn't know any better, because there are so many more native English speakers in North America than on any other continent, you might think that English had originated there.  On the other hand, if you looked for the most amount of variants of English over the shortest geographical distance, you would immediately home in on the British Isles and Frisia and Saxony.

The change in the way she perceived herself and how people around started to react to her presence was AMAZING... so she kept wearing that type external prosthesis.

aaaaah, I remember seeing it on a documentary somewhere.

I make testing tools for several different machines.   Tests from the old tool won't work on the next one, but we still need to test those machines.   The old tests were just a table of what commands to send, but it didn't support complex tests (that is it could turn a light on and off, but could turn a motor on until the temperature reached some value and then open a valve).    newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So my python script read those old tables, and converts to the new system.   The old system had a lot of almost duplicate rows - the same command to turn some warning light one, except they applied to different machines.   So my hash table took the row as a key, but took out what machine it applied to, and threw a duplicate test exception if the remainder existed, which was caught at a higher level and just applied the existing test to that machine.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There are about 10 different tests for each warning light, split among 1000s of different models.   We want to corrolate these tests because we have found many cases where the test didn't work on one machine becuase we had the wrong command (often the documentation was wrong), and further investigation revealed that most (but not necessarly all) machines that use that test had the wrong command, so we need to know what machines to go back and re-test. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Without revealing too much that is why I was doing it.

&gt; You cannot look at war as a popularity contest newlinechar  newlinechar You are refuting your own argument of a popular vote on the war.

Every German knew the war was justified. Like Herrmann Goering said : 'Naturally the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. ...Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.'

There be dragons here. :) newlinechar  newlinechar Problem one is that the more effort you put into make your app correctly handle US addresses, the more trouble you'll have with foreign addresses. A great deal of information is implied by the zip+4, so much that you will not be in 3NF if you actually store the zip along with the rest of the information traditionally written on an envelope. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to support multi-national addresses, the best thing to do is store a blob of text with the whole address in it and don't plan on doing any verification at all. newlinechar  newlinechar One solution a friend of mine is using is to store a big blob of text and then throw regexes across it to pull out information like the city, state, zip, etc. via stored procedures. I think that's fairly novel. newlinechar  newlinechar One other commenter mentions USPS.com offers address verification. I haven't looked into that; it sounds cool, but again, you're going to lose on foreign addresses.

Well thanks for the discussion.  A few final points on my end, and I'll give you the last word: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Thank you for not resorting to personal attacks.  I get voted down, obviously, but you haven't been screaming bigot at me like so many others on this thread do, and I appreciate having a discussion with someone that actually listens to opposing points of view without labeling them first. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) I understand the argument that marriage is the *result* of a committed relationship, but I ask this question:  If an option to publicly label one's committed relationship is removed, will that not damage relationships because they have no way of taking that extra step?  In my mind, marriage is not a label, but an extra step.  If it weren't, than the piece of paper wouldn't mean anything and committed non-married couples would be the same as married couples statistically. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Nope. I also wouldn't give preference to couples over single parents. Everything should be handled on a case-by-case basis. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) There are obviously some situations where a single parent would be better than a couple of some sort.  Making same-sex marriage legal and on the same plane as opposite-sex marriage takes away the ability of adoption agencies to choose a married, opposite-sex couple over same-sex all things being equal, even given that scientifically a married opposite-sex couple is best *and* a child would have access to a mother *and* a father in one, and two of one (and therefor not getting the benefits of the inherent natural differences in the sexes) in the other. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;However, not having a parent of one particular sex doesn't rule out having role model of that sex. Aunts, uncles, family friends, etc. That is something that the case worker would take into consideration. newlinechar  newlinechar 4) Role models are great, and they are needed.  But that is not the same as a mother or father, and it never will be obviously. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I would never preclude someone from adopting based solely on their orientation, though. newlinechar  newlinechar 5) I never would either.  It has everything to do with selecting the best situation for a child that is presently available to the child. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks again for the post.  Hopefully some of the others on this thread can learn from you style of discussion and having a rational discourse.

They did sort it out. Unfortunately, there are no cases quite like this as a precedent. As a result, the police couldn't technically charge her with anything illegal. Although it was highly immoral, there wasn't any charge they could give her that they could prove.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's important to note that she was aware this girl had a history of depression and mental instability. She was aware that hateful messages were being sent to her. She was the instigator of this revenge profile. And while she asked the other friends, whom she gave access to the account, to not be mean. She did at one point encourage them to give this girl a taste of her own medicine. Apparently she had been hurtful to the daughter in the past.  newlinechar  newlinechar I also find it interesting that it was one of the girls involved that actually outed this woman! She didn't even have the decency to turn herself in. She claims that she didn't think this girl was going to kill herself. However, she did know she was clinically depressed and in treatment for it. Depression is a major factor in suicide. Perhaps messages that say things like 'the world would be better off without you', from a depressed teenage girl's perspective, are all the proof one needs.  newlinechar  newlinechar I find it disgusting that a grown woman would set up a revenge account with her daughter, then include others in it, then claim to not be responsible for the outcomes.  newlinechar It's disgusting.  newlinechar  newlinechar But vigilante justice is not the answer, but the community rallying around the family who has tragically and needlessly lost their daughter while shunning the person who enabled that...no problem with me.

Military families take the office of the President (aka Commander &amp; Chief) very seriously.  They have faith that the governing authorities would always treat the military with the proper respect and would never abuse their authority over the military for political or self-gain.

Military families faith in government is based on honor above self. newlinechar  newlinechar To admit that the commander in chief has no honor is to admit to oneself that America is really 'amerika'.

Penn's opinion of the films is only that, his opinion.  He didn't give a considered appraisal of their aesthetic value, just called films about hobbits shit.  Well that's not intelligent criticism, just the opinion of an ahole.  Penn shouts as if this gives his opinions more authority.  His feigned anger is as lame as Bill O'Reilly's.  Redditors like Penn's schtick more because his sentiments are closer to their own.  Penn generally goes after the low hanging fruit: bottled water is expensive and foolish (gee, really?), polling can be an instrument of propaganda(he figured this out in 2007?), gun control laws mostly work against those who respect the law (damn, next he'll discover that criminals are lawbreakers)... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong, we do live in times when the restatement of the obvious may be the first duty of intelligent men (Orwell), but Penn's rants take far too long to say far too little.

They're already expected to keep up on this stuff, and read journals, and those that would ever prescribe quack medicine without the best of excuses (she was dying of cancer anyway, and though not approved by an independent testing lab, this was her best chance... in the FDA days it would have been on trial anyway, and I'd have tried to get her admitted to it) should lose their license. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Aside from the FDA and CDC coming out with rules on how to properly handle and cook meat, you mean? newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps, but most people aren't in the habit of boiling their lettuce. The problem is factory farming, but nothing will happen there. Too much profit. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You live in some parallel utopia where all customers are smart and all companies put their customers ahead of a buck. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd rather have $1 a month from a customer for life, than kill him selling him a $100 product. Especially if I'm then on the hook for $50 million in liability. newlinechar  newlinechar And I don't live in a parallel utopia. I live in your favorite world, where companies don't even bother developing drugs that would save thousands of lives, because the cost to get FDA approved is more than the profit could ever be.

Last time I went into a Best Buy, their computers weren't able to access the Tubes. So none of the above would work. newlinechar  newlinechar In the Apple Store I was fortunate enough to escape notice while performing the prank. I would do my dirty work on an isolated iBook, then walk away to look at the shelf of Mac games (yes, they exist). And then I would try to suppress a giggle as a sales staffer tried to sell the machine, ['My name is Raven and I'm an elitist asshole'](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2002/07/12) burning brightly on its display, to a curious customer. newlinechar

It probably isn't to abolish it in a single day. newlinechar  newlinechar If you had suggested this, most people would agree, me too. I think that Paul agrees here. Hell, even if private companies can do this, what about the interim? It'd take them 5 years to be viable, and we can't go 5 years without any oversight at all. newlinechar  newlinechar I know that Paul has transitionary policies in mind for all of this. And just because he wants all these seperate things, doesn't mean that he gets to do them even if we vote him in. We can vote him into office, and then apply social pressure on some of the stranger ideas if we want that. newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike Bush and the current Congress, I think the man will really listen to us. That's so rare, that passing up the chance to get him into office would be a bad mistake. We won't get that again for a very long time, and maybe never.

Sorry I can't provide citations, but I did read that the reduction in penile cancer is considerably less than the (low) risk of the procedure itself. newlinechar  newlinechar To my mind, having the old purple helmet drastically desensitized for a reduction in the risk of STDs is too high a price to pay, and certainly not one anyone should be imposing on children without their consent.  Better to educate them to use a condom and stay away from sluts. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, it does suck if it has to be done later, but it would also suck (relatively) to have an insensitive penis.  I know I'll get downmods from people who can't bear the thought that they might be missing out on something, but people who've had it done in later life say that sensitivity goes down from about a 10 to 2 or 3.  e.g. uncut men couldn't stand to have their bell-end rubbing against underwear, for instance. newlinechar  newlinechar I watched a TV program about it, and in the US, young women asked in the street said they didn't like the idea of an uncut man.  Conversely, in the UK, where about 3% of men are circumcised, young women were disgusted by the idea of a circumcised man...  Any arguments about aesthetics are simply informed by the local societal norms. newlinechar  newlinechar Circumcision became popular in the US as a result of Mr Kellogg, of Cornflakes fame, who thought it prevented masturbation, and masturbation caused insanity.  He was wrong on both counts.  We don't use leeches any more - circumcision should go the same way.
As I said I'd be a responsible parent and not accept their illicit activity so casually as you insinuated should be done in your OP. Of course I wouldn't go insane because I know how harmful weed is (not at all) but as a responsible parent I'd have to know how they're getting marijuana because many people who sell it are dangerous criminals and if they experiment with other drugs. newlinechar  newlinechar What would you do 'uhh hey dw it's cool just keep puffin it up in my backyard'. Your kid doesn't see this anyway other than that you don't care about the fact that they're smoking an illegal drug. Most teenagers that experiment with weed do it because it's illegal and so they think it's the cool thing to do. These personalities are often attracted to other drugs which is why misinformed people keep saying Weed is a gateway drug for heroine and crystal meth and such. newlinechar  newlinechar If you turn a blind eye to this you really don't have any moral highground over that guy, and I understand him because unlike the self-righteous redditors I realize that not all people are perfectly informed about marijuana. Why else are people voting for Giuliani and Clinton if it were not that they were awfully misinformed?

If 1466A is declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court -- there's a current challenge before them that they have yet to schedule to hear -- then HR 3791 wouldn't apply to that material. The bill leaves the definition of child pornography up to existing statutes. If those statutes are changed, the application of this bill changes with them. newlinechar  newlinechar So if you think the government has an over-broad definition of child pornography, this is not the front to attack.

Very strange.  I was born in St. Petersburg and I always thought that the reason it didn't have any buildings over 10-20 stories was because the city is essentially BUILT ON A SWAMP. newlinechar  newlinechar That's also the reason why it has the deepest subway system in the world - every escalator is easily 100 meters long. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So a skyscraper? weird.

That would be every politician in both the House and the Senate, with the **possible** exception of Ron Paul, whom I know has voted 'No' on bills he hasn't read (and thus can't be claimed to have passed them).  newlinechar  newlinechar I am referring to a perennial bill -- the Federal Budget -- which is routinely thousands of pages long and is submitted to the floor *the evening of the day before it is voted upon* with alarming frequency. newlinechar  newlinechar The Farm Act renewals are equally depressing. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: The Ron Paul statement was only an endorsement if you look at that as a good thing.

&gt;Thank you for not resorting to personal attacks. I get voted down, obviously, but you haven't been screaming bigot at me like so many others on this thread do newlinechar  newlinechar You're quite welcome.  I try never to personally attack someone I'm having a discussion with (unless they attack me first, in which case all bets are off).  It's counterproductive, at the very least.  Also, I haven't downvoted you at all.  I do my best to follow reddiquette, and only vote down posts that are uninformative and/or off-topic.  I find myself sorely tempted at times, but I certainly don't vote down people who are attempting to have an actual conversation. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if you feel the need to tell me that you can tell it's 'shopped by the pixels, or ask if 'u can has cheezburger', prepare to be downvoted (unless it's actually funny instead of a lame attempt to ride the meme bandwagon). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In my mind, marriage is not a label, but an extra step. If it weren't, than the piece of paper wouldn't mean anything and committed non-married couples would be the same as married couples statistically. newlinechar  newlinechar You can currently be married by a church without being legally married in the eyes of the law (look at Mormonism and polygamous marriages).  Likewise, you can obtain a marriage certificate without being wed religiously. newlinechar  newlinechar People often mentally merge the two, which makes these types of discussions difficult.  Basically, even if the state stopped recognizing marriage, people would still get married.   newlinechar  newlinechar So to respond to your comment, I think that marriage in the religious (and social) sense will always be available to people who want it, and marriage in the legal sense only indicates a greater commitment inasmuch as it forces people to put themselves in a legally actionable position with respect to their relationship.  Removing the legal option wouldn't damage any relationships, because they'd still have the religious (or social, if they're not religious) option available. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, being able to *display* a certain level of commitment is not the same as *having* that level of commitment.  Someone can be highly committed without being married, and someone can be poorly committed even when that *are* married.  The divorce rate is testimony enough to that.  So using marriage as a barometer for the commitment of a relationship is flawed from the beginning. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Making same-sex marriage legal and on the same plane as opposite-sex marriage takes away the ability of adoption agencies to choose a married, opposite-sex couple over same-sex all things being equal newlinechar  newlinechar And, all things being equal, that's great!  What you're proposing is that all things *aren't* equal, in which case I would expect the caseworker assigned to the child to make an appropriate decision as to what is best for the child.  Whether that decision fits with what *you* think is best for the child is another can of worms altogether;  One that could be opened even without the inclusion of same-sex marriages. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not trying to get in the last word, so feel free to respond if you wish.  I just have a habit of addressing any points that I feel need to be addressed, so I often end up with the last word after wearing down my 'opponent' in a war of attrition that I didn't even know I was fighting.
It's fundamentally different from programming, though, because medicine is recurring complexity while programming is new complexity.  Even if you know how to save a life, all 1000+ steps of it, there will still be lives needing saving.  But once you know how to solve a complex software problem, you have no reason to solve it again.  Any new problem will involve a different sequence of steps, because otherwise you'd just re-use the program you made for the first one. newlinechar  newlinechar I've written checklists several times for things like installation or build processes.  They invariably last no more than a couple days, because once I have the checklist, I can just turn it into a shell script, crontab, or makefile to run it automatically.  Then I don't need the checklist anymore, because the computer handles it for me.

There's a difference between an email service going down and being told you have lost your account. newlinechar  newlinechar In the first case is usually transient, and there is a good chance you'll be to get your email back in the near future.

&gt; Brainfart/typo. Read it as 'than'. Customers that don't die buy again. newlinechar  newlinechar That's not the disconnect I was referring to (I understood your point). newlinechar  newlinechar You blamed the E.coli outbreak on factory farming and referred to too much profit (one I agree with).  You then go on to imply that it's in the interest of companies to make a profit over the long term.  *There* is the disconnect.  If things were as you said, the E.coli outbreak would have never happened, right?  In addition, companies that did look out for their customers would be caught up in the media hype associated with tainted food (low spinach sales for a number of months). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; We laugh when 60 Minutes does an expose on $1000 hammers and accept it as a given, but then we talk about the FDA and it's an automatic assumption that they're giving us the best possible service for the lowest price? newlinechar  newlinechar The free market is charging $1000 per hammer, not the government.  The FDA has a fairly good track record of keeping the public safe with a few problems. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Doctors are already approved to weed out the quacks newlinechar  newlinechar Quack doctors?  Sure.  Quack medicine?  Not so much.  Then again, that's why there's peer review, which takes place in the FDA. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Coupled with a UL-like private testing firm, or even better with several, there's no real need for an FDA. newlinechar  newlinechar I would guess that one of your arguments against the FDA (as is one of mine) is their close work with 'big pharma' which may skew their approval process.  How would a private company (which would not have the legal or monetary resources of the US government) be able to do a better job and still pull a profit? newlinechar  newlinechar If you take a look at products in a drug store that are not approved by the FDA, there's a clear warning on it that says the FDA has not approved this product for the purpose it's being sold for.  Would you advocate the same in the FDA-less world?  Would you also apply the same rule to products that are not approved by the UL? newlinechar  newlinechar BTW, thanks for standing up to my arguments.  I find it rare that a libertarian gets their arguments past the equivalent of 'things will be better when Ron Paul is elected!1!11'.  I take back my earlier comment wondering aloud if you're stupid.
I posted the seven paragraphs of the article that couldn't be 'condensed' into ad hominem. Your proper response, then, would be either to admit that you shouldn't have included the entire article in your observation, or convinced me how what I pasted was all just in furtherance of argumentum ad hominem, as you had claimed.   newlinechar  newlinechar The 'tide' recognizes that you overstated your case to begin with and wouldn't qualify it when I pointed out its absurdity, but rather attacked me based on unfounded assumptions about my expectations and interests.
Because they do not have the same methodologies, due to the way they're conducted. newlinechar  newlinechar One of the biggest problems with exit polls is selection bias. Exit polls are only conducted in a few locations, and what if the interviewer only asks white people? Or only attractive people? Or only very old people? All these problems do not exist with properly conducted randomized phone opinion polls. newlinechar  newlinechar There is an even bigger problem, though. In order to have the results of an exit poll available on air as soon as polling ends, the polling organization stops the poll HOURS before the voting has ended. This results in late-hour voters not being represented. This was the huge problem in the 2004 exit polling, when morning polls showed Kerry as the overwhelming victor, but then the Republicans started outnumbering Democratic voters in the late hours, after exit polls have stopped being collected. newlinechar  newlinechar There's one more problem. In order for an opinion poll to be sufficiently accurate, it is very important for the participant to not be aware of what the poll will be used for. Otherwise, people might be inclined to try to influence the poll in some manner and less likely to tell the truth. Therefore, a typical questionnaire used by a political opinion poll looks something like this: newlinechar  newlinechar     How old are you? newlinechar     Do you think everyone should be allowed to own guns? newlinechar     Who is your most favorite baseball player? newlinechar     Do you prefer Pepsi or Coke? newlinechar     Did you vote in the last election? newlinechar     How many television sets do you have in your home? newlinechar     Has anyone in your family ever have cancer? newlinechar     Would you vote for Rudy Giuliani or Hillary Clinton? newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously, this is not possible in exit polls, which are usually as simple as, 'Who did you just vote for?'
My plan is Ron Paul?
I think what Rails really got right is that it took a bunch of 'good things', bound them up together, did it in a relatively disciplined way, and used a pleasant language.  That might not sound like much, but compared to some of the PHP spaghetti messes around, or the java/xml drudgeries elsewhere, it was a huge improvement. newlinechar  newlinechar These days, a lot of people are imitating it, so you could probably get something about as good in a language you already know.

I did read it. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that prominent evolutionists believe evolution and Christianity are incompatible is irrelevant unless they actually bring forth solid evidence to support that position.

Just because they were experts doesn't mean they couldn't be wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: About 1 second after posting I realized that my excerpt from the article could be interpreted as a straw man argument.  I'm not saying the whole article is bad because of that point.  That's just a part of it I particularly took issue with.  It's just that I think when they referred to religion and evolution being incompatible, they were thinking of a very assumptive interpretation of religion. newlinechar  newlinechar Their beliefs don't matter, only the facts they present.

Yes, no monopolies on information or knowledge. If I want to reimplement a piece of software in it's entirety then there should be no laws telling me that a person owns a fundamental part of mathematics. newlinechar  newlinechar Also it's worth noting that IP does not fit inside of any sane economic system.

You can simulate a 'tab' keypress and then check which field has focus, programmatically. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I hated using WinRunner, because its tests tend to be pretty brittle.

I think that it is a good analogy.  If your athiest friend went around telling his parishioners the truth do you think that he would still be welcomed in the confesional?  Some people may use a priest in place of psychologist or conselor, most people expect the priest to be gods conduit.  If something miraculous were to happen in front of your friend: virgin mary on a piece of toast  ;)   your friend's atheism would influence his ability to handle the sign from god. Just like the scientist might view some major discovery with a perspective clouded with creationism or ID.  Maybe his faith would cause him to ignore or even hide the discovery.  If he wanted be upfront and put his beliefs on his c.v or cover letter then cool.  But no lab is going to want to take the chance that he will not do the best work posssible.
That's a ridiculous statement.  PCP?  Pot affects coordination and balance.  You smoke too much and move too much, you can get dizzy and puke.  It's happened to me plenty of times.  And I can say with certainty that none of the pot I've had has been laced with PCP.
I'm not sure what my point is either, but I can assure you, it is a good one.
I'd say more with the color
&gt; Jews establishing an empire in South America? Native Americans being their descendants? newlinechar  newlinechar Right, those notions contradict what archaeologists know about the natives coming down from the Bering Strait around 12K years ago (I'm going by memory here). And there's not a scrap of archaeological evidence to suggest the natives actually landed in South America and moved north (I'm assuming your summary of the Book of Mormon is accurate here). newlinechar  newlinechar Likewise, the Book of Exodus is completely misleading if one tries to read it as genuine history. It's the story of over half a million people enslaved in Egypt for hundreds of years and then wandering the desert to the east for forty years. As far as scientists can tell, that just didn't happen. As Lazare writes: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Not only was there a dearth of physical evidence concerning the escape itself, as archaeologists pointed out, but the slate was blank concerning the nearly five centuries that the Israelites had supposedly lived in Egypt prior to the Exodus as well as the forty years that they supposedly spent wandering in the Sinai. Not so much as a skeleton, campsite, or cooking pot had turned up, Finkelstein and Silberman noted, even though 'modern archeological techniques are quite capable of tracing even the very meager remains of hunter-gatherers and pastoral nomads all over the world.'

Before I quit wasting my time, I had a crazy eastern european professor who worked at my university's tiny NLP lab for a required 'survey of languages' course (you know where you *learn* Prolog, **LISP**, and a *scripting language* to expand your understanding of logical and functional languages ...). As a result we ended up just learning Prolog all semester, and I partially implemented a toy Prolog in Scheme since that semester my load was absurdly light. As a result I have a knowledge of the various search algorithms and predicate calculus, but am lacking more in depth knowledge of logic programming. newlinechar  newlinechar So, does it cover things in the depth that say a 400 or 500 level course on logic programming would cover? Or, if you are familiar with *Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming*, does it cover things not covered sufficiently in *PAIP*? newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks much for the overview of its contents!

Cracking a password is O(1), and therefore P, if you're dealing with a single fixed output size compression function, as you know it'll be a fixed size table.  Even though that argument shows a misunderstanding, I'll grant you that assumption for now.   newlinechar  newlinechar Such a 'password cracking algorithm' relies on being able to exhaustively enumerate all the hashes with a corresponding password to generate it (note that it may not be possible to create such a table via brute force even with infinite computing power).  Once you have the table though, you can use it to crack any password in amortized O(1) time.  It's fixed size after all.  newlinechar  newlinechar However that a password hash that used an encryption algorithm instead of a compression function (storing the entire output) would require a brute-force attack, and that a dictionary attack could at best take advantage of bone-headed users who insist that 'Password1' is a good password even after it shows up in the dictionary.  It's a heuristic, suggesting that some inputs are more likely than others.  As such, it's an optimization in some cases, and a pessimization in others (No Free Lunch Theorem).  You can't ever calculate the entire table, any more than you can count all the way to infinity.  The best you can do is to 'memoize' the output for a particular attempt, so that if somebody gives it to you later, you can find it in amortized O(log n) time (not constant time anymore, because the size of the table is no longer bounded.  I'm feeling generous however, ans so I'll give you constant time multiplication and memory access).  And so you end up with O(2^n).  For the price of remembering _one_ _more_ _bit_, I can force you to have to calculate and remember everything you ever did, one more time. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, broadening the scope to NP problems.  All hash functions have some internal structure that we can use, if we can wrap our heads around it, to 'solve' it in less time than brute force (witness MD4, MD5, SHA1, etc).  Many NP-complete problem _instances_ also have such a structure.  If P==NP, then all of them do.  The problem is that you can't tell if there's structure to be taken advantage of until you've already found it (proof by contradiction:  a proof of P!=NP that uses such a technique would have to include an P algorithm to solve NP problems;  I can get you the paper if you want), and nobody has been able to come up with a good reason for literally random instances of 3SAT (for instance) to have such a structure.   newlinechar  newlinechar If there's no structure, then you have to fall back on the 'dictionary against variable length hash function' algorithm.  And then you're still stuck with the problem that adding one more city to your route will require doing all that n times again.
O.**K**. 
&gt;Firsty, it is unavoidable that sometimes the result is outside of the margin of error. newlinechar  newlinechar You have no understanding of what you're talking about. By the very definition of the term, the result is *inside* the margin of error. That's why they call it the 'margin of error'. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Even in the abstract 'ideal' case. 95% confidence means that it is espected that in 5% of the cases the result falls outside the bounds. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes. That's called 'margin of error'. See above. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;With so many polls, your statement therefore is not true. newlinechar  newlinechar This incorrect statement stems from you not having an understanding of what 'margin of error' means. See my first point above. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;All kinds of biases need to be filtered out, so you get a model that's used to 'process' the raw data newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, this is done. There are still some questions about the bias of some of the questions being asked, but in general, reputable polling organizations are aware of all the biases that go into this, and have ways to try to minimize them. They aren't perfect, though, and that is why they get the 'margin of error'. newlinechar  newlinechar P.S.: [MARGIN OF ERROR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error)
Worse, if the questions were asked vocally, how can we seperate biases from the person's body language, intonation, and inflection? newlinechar  newlinechar If the pollster asks with disgust in his voice 'Do you support Kucinich?' and then with unadulterated admiration 'Do you support Clinton?'... will that even show up in the methodology at all?

I guess technically I can't claim that.  However, my grandma was a native Sichuanese, and she occasionally 'tried' to speak Mandarin with a distinguishable style known for many Sichuanese people.

&gt; I don't know why you were downmodded; this is actually an excellent idea. newlinechar  newlinechar It's been discussed before at length. It's a very contentious issue with many downsides that took an event like 9/11 for it to even be considered. I doubt any political party would have considered it in response to the threat intell they had. They'd need to sell it to the public and pre-9/11 I doubt that would be possible.  newlinechar  newlinechar What should have been done was scaled up anti-terrorism operations, as well as making sure that airport security was aware of the threat. Plus the flying schools should have been monitored. Having the 'pilots' learn in the US was a stupid tactical mistake and it should have been picked up on given the intell available (the infamous 'determined to attack' report). newlinechar  newlinechar However, here's a good argument against arming pilots: it's not necessary any more. It only took a few hours for the world to come to the realization that a hijacking is now a potential suicide bomb. This was evident on Flight 93 where the passengers changed from the normal 'be compliant and you'll live' response to being held hostage to 'you have nothing to lose by fighting back'. You can bet that if anyone tries to hijack a plane again, the passengers will attack en-mass. IIRC the 'shoe bomber' guy was tacked by everyone in reach of him the moment he attempted to blow up the plane.

Islam is derived from the word 'salam' which means peace.Let's start with 'Killing' in Islam first because killing in itself is against the religion. In chapter 2 verse 190-193, It states that this is for a defensive war (no offense, because Islam is peace remember) and if a Muslim community or a person is attacked without any justification or opressed and are being prevented from practicing their religion/faith, then they have the permission to fight back, but even then the Muslim person or community are told not to transgress limits and are to stop and fighting if the attacker/enemy gives up. The muslim person/community are only to fight the attacker/enemy not innocent bystanders or non-combatants (hence suiciding bombing is against islam because innocent people are getting hurt every day). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now that we have that in mind. Now from what I remember (I'll check this when I'm at home later because I'm at work now) newlinechar  newlinechar Chapter 2 verse 256 states the freedom of religion.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Chapter 5 verse54 states that those who say that they believe in Islam then rejects his faith and opress or prevent other people who have accepted Islam will be fought against until they have given up.

I've read a lot of Vonnegut's books, short stories, and essays.  Vonegut was ambiguous about religion.  He was a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church and explained his membership by saying the Unitarians were the closest religion to no religion at all, if I remember right. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Vonnegut really can't be included as a 'famous atheist'.  He never outright denied the existance of a God. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  His quote isn't represented fairly, it should have been attributed to the character in the book, but I'm sure that Vonnegut, at least most of the time,  felt that way.

I know a lot of people around here, some of whom are not nearly as well informed as they ought to be, if they are going to make such a serious choice about their lives. I do my part to help, but the point stands that if I like people who might be conned, and I describe to them the issues of such chicanery, then there are other people that I might like that are similarly uninformed. Not everybody has the impulse to research the nature of our society in the way that I do. This is fine, they have other interests that redeem them. Not everyone WANTS to be a reformer or a revolutionary. Whether they are in pursuit of higher goals(Science, arts, the desire to actually defend the country in the way our military was originally envisioned), or simply bludgeoned into apathy from current events, that does not mean they deserve to get sold a line. If someone does something and is fully informed of the possible consequences of their action, that is fine by me. That said, what many army recruiters do is nothing short of predatory, and if I can help the people around me to make an informed decision, rather than an uninformed one, I feel the better for it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Even people I don't like do not automatically deserve to be tricked. It's the ones I like that cause me concern.

This is the smugness I was talking about. The implication here is that religious people are unintelligent.

It's an individual acceptance of a perception of that same reality that just happens to be different than that of the atheist's. Where it becomes a movement is when you band together in groups and societies and  communities, official or otherwise, start writing manifestos and unifying value statements.

Uh, no, they do have a right to fire you.  Your job is not to fund-raise, your job is to preach.  Preachers often do have administrative roles, but their primary duty is to preach the word of God.  So if you won't do that, you're not doing your job.   newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, you've basically committed fraud, because you know that a fundamental aspect of your job is preaching God's word and you know you can't fulfill that.  Misrepresentation can be done by concealment as well as by assertion.  Since you knew that you would not able to fulfill the prime purpose of the job you were seeking, and took it anyway, you misrepresented yourself.  The contract can be voided.

This is a popular dismissal of expression that suggests real change is needed.  Truth is that frequently it takes a great deal of talking before a sufficient number of people are properly motivated to make meaningful change.  The Revolution simmers below the surface and as it heats the message spreads.  Spreading the word is crucial for this revolution to actually come off.  This revolutionary restoration of rights and freedoms can take place through elections if enough people really get the word.  The elections are not being held tonight.  You can be a cynic, but right now the action is on the web.  People talking.  People raising money to raise awareness.  When the elections come you will see more action and if enough people between now and then spread the word the results will be shocking to the cynics and elites so invested in the status quo. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Let's pursue the restoration of genuine American values peacefully through the vote so we don't have to contemplate something far bloodier.
I see myself holding a body length mirror in front of you.
Yes, it is far better that this change take place by a resounding declaration of American will to restore the best of American values.  We need people from both parties and from all over the political spectrum to recognize the importance of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Are you a Republican who thinks that legalizing drugs will be horrible for society?  Think through all the issues before rejecting Ron Paul for favoring freedom and due process of the law over those who profit from the drug war.  Are you a Democrat who thinks that aborting unborn babies is good because it makes women indistinguishable from men in an important respect?  Realize that Ron Paul wants to avoid the type of fight this nation had over slavery when the Supreme Court wrongly decided Dredd Scott and that left to the states to figure out is a better solution for your interests than something akin to the Emancipation Proclamation binding on every state. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, as for the 2nd, I'm armed.  Lots of people who support Paul are.  Let us hope and pray that it never comes to pass that Americans have to take up arms against fellow Americans to restore our rights, but let those who seek to deny Americans their rights may they take to heart Jefferson and Patrick Henry. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with **the blood of patriots** and **tyrants**.'  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?

It can either be murder OR manslaughter! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That's leaving it up to the states, right? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Because if a fetus IS given 14th Amendment protections, there really isn't any *other* choice available.

'We' is Flying Frog Consultancy. newlinechar  newlinechar The single most important advantage of Windows Forms programming in F# compared to LablGTK in OCaml is the support provided by the interactive development environment. Specifically, Visual Studio's intellisense makes it extremely easy to learn an API like Windows Forms. newlinechar  newlinechar The equivalent calls in LablGTK are often comparably simple (although they tend to require weird castings through phantom-typed class hierarchies) but there is no way to explore the API interactively. OCamlbrowser is better than nothing but it doesn't even provide hyperlinks to related definitions, so it is very cumbersome to use by comparison. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, it isn't even feasible to add intellisense for LablGTK because OCaml's object system is structurally typed as opposed to .NET's nominally-typed OOP.

I've been writing software full-time in the popular dynamically-typed languages -- Perl, Python, Ruby -- since ~2000, so it's not an issue of unfamiliarity. newlinechar  newlinechar Smalltalk got it right (in fact, it got most things right, which most dynamically-typed language designers subsequently ignored) almost three decades ago. Then along comes Perl, which got it wrong at first, then introduced lexical scoping with strict mode, and therefore got it right. Similar story for Lua, except that Lua has the mistake of making common words unnecessarily long (e.g.: 'function' and 'local' keywords) and if you forget to define a variable local it automatically becomes global (!). newlinechar  newlinechar Neither Perl or Smalltalk have much syntactic overhead. I hope I'm not too rusty with either of them here: newlinechar  newlinechar Perl: newlinechar  newlinechar     my( $foo, $bar, $baz ) = ( 5, 10, 15 ); newlinechar  newlinechar ...with an alternative of: newlinechar  newlinechar     my $foo = 5; newlinechar     my $bar = 10; newlinechar     my $baz = 15; newlinechar  newlinechar Smalltalk: newlinechar  newlinechar     | foo bar baz | newlinechar     foo := 5 newlinechar     bar := 10 newlinechar     baz := 15 newlinechar  newlinechar If I recall correctly, Smalltalk also has some shortcuts (anyone care to comment?). newlinechar  newlinechar Neither of them is ideal, obviously, since there's some still noise. However, they demonstrate that it's possible to do it with a minimum of typing. If you were to mix Perl and Smalltalk's scheme, you could reduce the typing overhead to two characters for an arbitrary number of variables and assignments. Oh no! Two! Maybe one even, depending on the grammar, although that's probably too easy to miss when scanning code. newlinechar  newlinechar So I really don't understand this reticence that Python and Ruby harbor over a good idea. Ruby looks like it's slowly coming around. I'm happy that efforts are being made in Python to fix the scoping problems, but once again history is being ignored. newlinechar  newlinechar I like variable declaration before assignment not just because it makes closures easy, nor just because it makes mistyping variables more difficult. I also like it because it serves as a code signal -- implemented properly you _know_ at a glance that foo wasn't used higher up in the fuction, making refactoring easier. More importantly, it catches errors sooner; tests are slower than the compiler, and you won't be bitten if your tests don't provide full coverage (which in the real world almost never happens). newlinechar  newlinechar I think I can guess Guido's reasons for supporting nonlocal, and it's not a bad idea, but it skips the above problems.

No, this is not your point. You don't need a huge police force to protect the worker's right to strike but you need one to repress it.

That's very unlikely.

Even 'random' data in the form of a public key can be verified: have them sign a message with the corresponding private key. In general, though, I agree that it is unreasonable for a sufficiently complex message for any signer to make any absolute guarantees about its legitimacy or safety, but that is what they purport to do. newlinechar  newlinechar It seems that according to the definition for a cryptographic algorithm given [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual/html_node/Digital-signatures.html), MD5 is indeed broken due to the collision resistance requirement. But only when the same source generates both &lt;x&gt; and &lt;x'&gt;, not in general. I'm not opposed to using stronger hashes than MD5, I just want people to understand what is possible and what isn't. newlinechar  newlinechar This collision resistance requirement comes about because the signer is allowed leniency in authenticating a message. They are not required to verify its efficiency, to ensure that the message is complete and that every part of it is integral, that nothing extra is added. Perhaps this is a practical concession in the real world, but it really seems like a cop-out to me. When reading the election prediction paper, you get to the point where they explain the message is in the form of a PDF with embedded data and it's immediately obvious that this would put the message's legitimacy in question. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, the weakness opened up in MD5 is that a single source may be able to produce multiple messages with the same hash. But the only valid use of this hash is to verify that the message you received matches the one your source intends to distribute. The fact that the same source can now generate multiple (likely somewhat questionable) messages with the same hash doesn't change this, although it gets a bit more complicated when intermediaries like the console companies are involved. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, respecting an EOF character and aborting when you're supposed to be signing the entire message is a bug, an implementation error, plain and simple.

Give me a break.  Is that *really* molten steel?  All sorts of burning and molten crap was falling down; it could be anything. newlinechar  newlinechar I can't believe I have to spell this out for you. newlinechar  newlinechar You want to talk about extreme heat?  Let's talk about *burning* steel, *burning* concrete, from the combined factors of a raging fire in the upper floors, and the raw *kinetic energy* of falling mass during the building's collapse. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's talk about the sheer shock of the impact and explosion, which sent fireballs through the elevator shafts and shook the foundation.  Could this have possibly weakened the steel beams?  Hm.  The further shock of the final collapse delivered incredible stresses.  The beam could've been shorn, it could've been cut. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's talk about the timing of the building collapse.  It took more than an hour after the plane hit, to fall.  The collapse itself lasted on the order of minutes.  It's more than likely that crap fell on the broken beam after it was severed.  Gobs of molten steel were falling all around; you can see the effects plainly in other pictures. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's look at the distribution of the molten steel on the broken beam.  It it were cut using controlled burning, you'd see a more-or-less even distribution, with a tendency for more of the drippings near the bottom part of the cut.  Why are there portions of the cut that are clear of molten steel?  The bottom corners are devoid of accumulation. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's look at the molten steel on the beam.  Wait - is it even molten steel?  That beam must be ten feet across.  From this distance, it looks more like cement than metal.  Frankly, I can't tell what it is.  *You* say it's molten steel.  But forgive me if I'm not inclined to take your word at face value. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, let's look at the angle of the cut.  If you want to cut a steel beam, the easiest and most effective way is to make the break flat across the beam.  You can distribute more explosive in a smaller area, and make use of the compressive shock inside the beam, which would be more dispersed with a diagonal distribution. newlinechar  newlinechar So why make a diagonal cut?  Gee, do you think that the CIA agents who planted the explosives gave you little conspiracy theory nutjobs a little easter egg to discover?  Is it artistic flair?  Or maybe a shout-out to their friends in Mossad? newlinechar  newlinechar You look at this picture and see irrefutable facts.  What, are you an expert on building demolition?

If someone claims that the government of &lt;country&gt; is involved in a cover up of &lt;event with international consequences&gt;, there will be something in official accounts (the ones that get reported about by news agencies with websites) that is contradictory, extremely dubious, or at least a little off.

You still have no justification for thinking you're in the few. newlinechar  newlinechar To wit: I know one fields medalist. I know a couple of mathematical prodigies.

&gt;...and Chomsky thinks a better candidate would be...? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm taking issue with your choice of word 'candidate.' The question of how to do things better is obviously an open debate, and chomsky has his opinions on that too (though not on this article). But it's not as though thoughtful historical analysis is without value. If you think that just throwing a Ron Paul or a Dennis Kucinich (or even a Ralph Nader) into the president's chair is going to fix everything then you're totally missing the point of his work. He does advocate a number of concrete ideas (universalism of morality, consensus building, opportunity implies responsibility, etc.), but just because he doesn't end it with a 'and that's why you should support XY next election!' doesn't make it 'not constructive.'
You think that barring atheists or Jewish people from owning property or holding public office is a MORAL issue and not a rights restriction? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You're wrong.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;things talked about in the 'We the People Act' relate specifically to issues of morality. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You haven't read the act then. Not too surprising, given that you don't seem to have read the Constitution either. It covers things like education as well, which is hardly a 'moral' issue. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It is the libertarian position that morality issues are to be decided at the local level, newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Nope, that's the *Republican theocrat* position. The Libertarian position is that moral issues are to be decided *by the individual without interference from the government.* Libertarians simply do not support taking Constitutional rights away from the individual and giving them to the state as privileges to grant or deny on a whim.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Being a Ron Paul supporter doesn't make you a Libertarian--especially when all that attracts you comes straight from the Republican playbook. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But even if this is truly what YOU want--to make it impossible to challenge state-level religious discrimination--you'd still have to amend the Constitution to nullify the 14th amendment. You simply cannot legislate away our Constitutional rights. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But seriously, you can give them up if you want. If you're unable to choose a church without your state legislature holding your hand, just call them up and ask them what they want you to do. No need to amend the Constitution to require everyone else to do it too. newlinechar  newlinechar

I respectfully disagree.  What I believe you are referring to is the fact that on a daily basis Humans engage in a wide array of emotions and actions, some of those may be less virtuous than others.  However, you cannot simply look at one action of an individual and conclude they are 'EVIL'.  It is far more complicated.  I have a simple sense of morality, as long as what you do doesn't hurt anyone, then what you do is 'moral'.  I believe that is as broad and abstract as a definition for morality can be.

&gt; I just wrote a post disagreeing with you and you reply by repeating yourself. newlinechar  newlinechar I did not repeat anything. That was my first comment on this page. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It's unscientific and illogical to require different standards of proof for different claims. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's a page that covers some of the statistics and ideas behind my comment: newlinechar  newlinechar [Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation](http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html) newlinechar  newlinechar A good quote from the piece (bear in mind that CSNV is a rare condition): newlinechar  newlinechar 'Carl Sagan (1934-1996) famously said 'Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.' Intuitively this seems like good philosophy, but we have just seen that it is actually a precise statement about mathematics, not just a vague claim about philosophy. For an ordinary claim ('Pat has a cold'), evidence in the form of a test that has a 99% chance of being correct is good enough to give you 92% confidence in the result. But for an extraordinary claim ('Sam has CNSV'), a test with 99% probability really doesn't help much; we would need a test with something like 99.999% accuracy before we will start to believe the claim.' newlinechar  newlinechar If by standard of proof you simply mean that the evidence must lead to the same level of confidence in any claim before you believe it then I agree with you. My point is simply that some claims are less plausible and thus require greater amounts of proof before you can reach that confidence level. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

For context, my job is working on ejabberd for an instant messaging appliance. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I just read the specification for the AMQP protocol.. pardon me but it seems a heck of a lot easier to follow than XMPP. newlinechar  newlinechar Uh, no. I think you misunderstand something about XMPP. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Going to xmpp.org and finding this didn't help with my confidence for XMPP: newlinechar  newlinechar Those are optional modules. XMPP is modular. You use as much as you need. Of course the core XMPP RFC isn't as functional as the whole of the (as far as I can tell) unmodular AMQP. The core is designed to be as minimal as possible. Then you layer on what you need. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, servers typically come with many of the additional XEPs pre-implemented for you, but the vast majority of them don't impact you unless you want them to. The modularity isn't _perfect_ (can't be, really), but it is pretty good. newlinechar  newlinechar There are entire concepts in AMQP that are either entirely optional in XMPP, or simply uncovered by any aspect of XMPP that I know of. The first means XMPP is simpler, the second means there are cases for which XMPP is not appropriate. There are also major XMPP extensions such as discovery that I see no equivalent for in the AMQP spec, probably because the use case for discovery is assumed to not apply in the AMQP world; you'll already know what every entity is and can do.  newlinechar  newlinechar XMPP started life as an instant message protocol, and the further you get from that use case, the worse off you are. It's easy for me to see that AMQP is designed for a different world, where messages are, on average, far more important than the average XMPP message, where the _usual_ message relationship is more complicated than one-to-one (XMPP of course has stuff to handle that, but one-to-one is the 'base case' of the protocol), and where processing speed trumps human comprehensibility where necessary. newlinechar  newlinechar On the scale of human to computer, XMPP is about as human-friendly as SMTP or HTTP. It looks like AMQP is much more human-hostile. Which one is better depends on your needs. newlinechar  newlinechar For a messaging product based on yet another set of needs, see [Spread](http://www.spread.org). This one is all about programs talking to programs, and also concentrates on many things XMPP doesn't. newlinechar  newlinechar Broadly, I'd say XMPP is better suited for internet-scale deployments where you need the human-friendliness and flexibility to work well. (There's a reason all the major Internet protocols are fairly human-friendly, often involving such apparent silliness as sending numeric error codes as ASCII numbers.) AMQP and Spread are much more useful for internal, controlled deployments where such friendliness doesn't matter. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I don't think XMPP and AMQP overlap much at all, and I doubt we'll be seeing much competition between them, any more than Exchange/MAPI really 'competes' with SMTP.

&gt;Using different currencies isn't a big deal. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think you're not thinking this all the way through.  Why?  Because if he revoked the legal tender act, and dollars no longer were manditory payment in the US, the first thing that would happen is that the dollar would become worthless.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar All of the money markets and investors would divest themselves of it immediately.  Why the hell would *anyone* keep investing in a currency if even its issuing government didn't believe in it any more?  Europe, China, etc would all rid themselves of dollars and the market would get flooded.  Foreign businesses would probably refuse to accept them all together. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Domestically, this would cause prices (in dollars) to skyrocket.  Maybe 100% American goods wouldn't be as badly effected, but the fact is, virtually nothing produced is truly 100% American.  Even on simple things like harvested foods, try keeping the prices down when gasoline is $50/gal.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And in the meantime, nothing is in a position to take up the slack and replace the dollar.  Sure, a bunch of people have invested in various gold commodities, but the economy sure isn't going to be able to switch over to a barter system overnight. (yes, with gold being traded as a commodity, it WOULD be a barter system)  How do you tell Visa or your bank that this month's payment is going to be an eighth ounce of gold?   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Life would probably be easiest on the border states.  Texas, Arizona, New Mexcio would probably just start trading in pesos, and similarly the northern border (myself included) would adopt the Canadian dollar.  But, of course, that's only good locally.  I have no idea if, say, my student loan holders would take a CA dollar.  I'd have to renegotiate every single debt I have.  And since all the banks that hold my debts are a lot more powerful than me, I'll probably get screwed in the deal.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I really have no idea what would happen in the middle of the country.  Probably just keep swapping dollars for awhile, despite the incredible inflation, and hope for the best.  Maybe start swapping chickens for wrenches.  They wouldn't just 'carry on.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The *only* upshot to Paul's plan is that, since the national debt is in dollars, this would effectively wipe it out.  The currency would be so devalued that the debt would become worthless.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But I don't think it's worth the hell he'd put the country through. 
Check your memory. Billy Graham was not among those on whom Gorner blew the whistle. Graham has always been head, shoulders and torso above the questionable actions of those Gortner associated with.

I don't know why you're being downmodded for making a decent post.  I must not have read the topic well I guess, so you're right.  VB &lt;&gt; open source.  However, VB will teach you the basics of programming and structure and using different methods.  After you learn the basics, open source is not that difficult to shift too.
Wait... newlinechar  newlinechar Are you Scottish?
Stories are more then just lies, they are teaching tools, and have been a traditional way of passing knowledge for thousands of years. newlinechar  newlinechar The line between reality and myth can become blurry, and that is ok.  It's when people insist that the story is true, and to say otherwise is blasphemy that there is a problem. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider the story of Hansel and Gretel, on it's own it is a story that teaches about wandering away from home, being too trusting of strangers, etc.  When you are young with a active imagination the line between reality and that fiction may become blurred.   newlinechar  newlinechar The danger of wandering off into the woods and being trusting of strangers that offer to take you in and give you everything is real, however the reasons are manifested in fiction, rather then the real dangers.  As you grow up and mature the mythical reasons are replaced with real ones. newlinechar  newlinechar Santa is, when you really get down too it, a childs version of God.  He knows when you've been bad or good, he rewards good behaviour by giving presents, etc.  The lesson is good, be good and you'll get good things.  Eventually you grow up and realise that there is no Santa, but the principle is sound, be nice to people and people will be nice too you. newlinechar  newlinechar It is a story, that teaches a lesson in a 'innocent' way, and there is nothing wrong with it.  Eventually the child is meant to grow up, expand there understanding of the world and realise that it was just a story. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally I think it is wrong to take fantasy away from children, almost as wrong as it is for fantasy to dictate laws and government policy...

&gt; I don't know the details of the municipalities you mentioned,  newlinechar  newlinechar If you're going to write *'The ONLY way to successfully protect water resources is for someone to have property right on that water,'* then take time to get educated about the issue. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; but I do know that most the southeast are suffering from water shortages. Why? For the same reason the USSR had food shortages.  newlinechar  newlinechar The USSR had a command economy run from a central committee. That is not how water resources are managed in the United States. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Yeah, I'm sure natural conditions contributed too, but it was the political ones that were overwhelming. newlinechar  newlinechar [citation needed] newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Corporations creating a scarcity of water on a planet that is 7/8 covered with it would be a real trick. newlinechar  newlinechar Not all the planet's water is potable or available for human consumption. Furthermore, urban areas require extensive distribution and sanitation infrastructure, which, [by its very nature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly), needs to be managed by a single entity and does not lend itself to multiple suppliers. newlinechar  newlinechar Due to these realities, it's not difficult to imagine how a company with full ownership over water and no regulatory oversight could create artificial scarcity. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; That is unless they get the government to put in a bunch of bullshit rules and regulations to inhibit competition. newlinechar  newlinechar I fail to see how granting private ownership over water resources and eliminating oversight would encourage entrepreneurship. newlinechar  newlinechar If BigMcLargeHuge Corp owned a county's riparian rights and water utility, land owners could be forbidden from drilling their own wells. newlinechar  newlinechar Even if someone invented a method to extract water from sand, how would she be able to deliver the product to customers without BigMcLargeHuge's pipes? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; In other words socialism doesn't work. newlinechar  newlinechar Socialism is a broad concept. To determine if it works or not depends on the resource, and how you are defining 'Socialism.' newlinechar  newlinechar If you're going to make a case for the full privatization of water, screaming 'Socialism' isn't a rational argument for the idea. newlinechar  newlinechar ON EDIT: Fixed grammar and spelling.

Switching from getchar to fread is a big speed up on any compiler I've used.

I didn't actually mention foreign policy, but it is one of the issues with which I agree with Ron Paul as well. That, and his general ethos of personal liberty that will, among other things, abolish the 'war' on drugs. newlinechar  newlinechar It's true that things are so messed up right now in those respects that I can see why Ron Paul has so much appeal, since I have no doubt that he will fix those issues. newlinechar  newlinechar But unlike you, I can't overlook his stance on many other domestic and social issues. He's for scrapping income tax and the IRS, which explains why he's against a single-payer healthcare system and the welfare state. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it's a step backwards to dismantle all that, and will hurt many people. As for debating it later, it's always easier to tear things down than to build them back up again. I don't doubt Ron Paul's intelligence, I just don't think he's a particularly compassionate person. newlinechar  newlinechar Which is why I prefer Kucinich - there's no fear or war mongering to be found in his foreign policy, and he's right on the domestic and social issues. newlinechar  newlinechar And thanks for replying - it's usually suicide to be critical of Ron Paul on a reddit comments page!

&gt; The naive implementation article is a good argument against simplicity. newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree.  Simplicity only matters for things that actually work.  If I can remove a line of code which then prevents my code from compiling, it's not simpler, it's broken. newlinechar  newlinechar So to the extent that correctness is necessary, the naive version is broken and therefore how apparently simple it is doesn't matter. newlinechar  newlinechar However, it's much simpler then to have one authoritative version of the function, which is well-tested and analyzed, which is then both correct and singular, than having multiple equivalent implementations written with varying levels of naiveté and correctness, which then violates the DRY principle.

Google became the king of search in part because by not performing stemming by default they were able to return more relevant search results than the other engines of the time.

The Commission concluded that the hijackers crashed the plane to keep the crew and passengers from gaining control. newlinechar  newlinechar From what it seems to me is that they took the plane done EXACTLY because it was after the main parts of 9/11.

Your retort doesn't make sense. I don't know why you're getting upmodded. I didn't say anything about 'correct' algorithms. Mr_Smartypants asked how you could reduce randomness (of the algorithm's outcome) by 'swapping things more than once'. See example above for answer.

&gt;Hundreds upon hundreds of experiments have already been conducted on the ISS, and each mission adds dozens more. Just because they're not publicized doesn't mean they aren't important, or that they aren't happening. newlinechar  newlinechar That's the part about the ISS I'm questioning. I don't really believe they are doing 'hundreds of experiments', all they're doing is moving money from the taxpayers to NASA's contractors. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The only reason you would say such a thing is because you do not value pure research for the sake of obtaining knowledge about the universe. All you're concerned about is practical research. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason I'm saying that is because I believe the [6.4 billion could be spent on real science, like more probes](http://politics.reddit.com/info/62imr/comments/c02mnfu).

Fine - Smalltalk overall was much better than the JVM prior to hotspot.  It took a few generations to equal Smalltalk, and the massive hotspot enhancement (acquired from an experimental Smalltalk called Strongtalk) before they surpassed the best commercial Smalltalk (which is probably Visualworks).   newlinechar  newlinechar The Visualworks's VM is still fairly competitive (it has a JIT and is about half as fast on the Sieve of Eratosthenes) and on a tiny little item like this, there isn't a big impact on execution speed overall anyhow.  I found benchmark results here: http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.SpeedOfJavaCppRuby (search for Smalltalk in the page). newlinechar  newlinechar So, I think Gosling has been proven to be fairly clueless on this score.

Actually, Shareware is much more profitable on a mac. People who are passionate enough to pay a $1K mark up on their laptop will have little quams paying $25 for an app that tracks all their DVD and book purchases, and does it well.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think Ambrosia, a profitable shareware company that's been around since before the internet, stated that their researched indicated that only about 1 in 250 people on windows pay for Shareware.

France went on backing the killers even as the bodies piled up in the streets, churches and football stadiums.
Heh, you're actually probably right. newlinechar  newlinechar Honestly, I think you should learn the basics. Read the 'best' book on the language you want to learn. Learn it well. Then, just program anything you can think of... however small. At first, your programs probably won't turn out the best. Your code layout might be sloppy; there will probably be a lot of bugs. But that's a good thing. newlinechar  newlinechar As you continue to program, you'll stop making mistakes you used to make. You'll discover better ways to accomplish certain things. You'll be able to organize your code more efficiently; your code will be smaller, simpler, easier to read. newlinechar  newlinechar You learn to program by programming. No other method will teach you better. newlinechar  newlinechar Reading books and tutorials is a good thing, also. There are a lot of 'must-reads' for programmers that should probably be read. I also recommend you learn assembly, just because it teaches so much about what's actually going on... newlinechar  newlinechar Reading/working on open-source code can be a great help as well. Some things you'll not have even thought of will be brought to light in this way. newlinechar  newlinechar Have fun.

I found it rather poor. Most of the corrections to so-called myths are just common wisdom. And in the case of psychopathy being untreatable, they are dead wrong. As a matter of empirical fact (not some yahoo's isolated opinion) psychological treatment of psychopaths is generally *negatively* effective. That is, psychopaths get worse through treatment. This is quite remarkable and puts an extraordinary onus on anyone claiming a treatment is effective. Now, Hare proposed a protocol which may work at curbing psychopaths' criminal tendencies, maybe, but it certainly will never cure their psychopathy. But given that society is better off executing psychopaths (the only justified basis for capital punishment is in fact psychopathy since *their very existence* is harmful to society) then having a reason to release them into the wild is certainly no cause for rejoicing.
Because in today's times, it's a crime to think!

The word 'sociopath' is the product of the idiotic PC euphemism treadmill. Worse than that, 'sociopath' is usually associated with newer definitions of psychopathy. Definitions which deviate from 'lack of empathy' to 'disruptive to society'. Nowadays, any dissident or subversive person is a 'sociopath' according to the DSM. You couldn't ask for better if you were building a Fascist state. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you wanted to re-use 'sociopath' to make it meaningful, you would not make it a washed out version of psychopath. Rather, you would analogize it to psychopaths. A psychopath is someone who doesn't see other psyches (they think of humans as dogs basically) because they lack empathy. A sociopath would be someone who doesn't see social rules (not just ignores them but is ignorant of them) because they lack whatever makes this necessary. But you know what? There already is a word for this: autistic. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So pretty much, 'sociopath' should be consigned to the dustbin of 'meaningless invented words' and 'an Orwellian assault on language'.

Very interesting.  I certainly wouldn't claim that the US market would go away (barring prohibition, which is very unlikely), but it could stop growing and even shrink a little, depending on drinking/social/religious/economic trends. newlinechar  newlinechar Since the 1980s, regulation of alcohol has increased quite a bit.  It's no guarantee that, say, more states won't pass 3.2% beer laws or more blue laws limiting the hours of alcohol sale.

No, very little is made with export in mind.  The market for Japanese movies in America is essentially nonexistent.  Perhaps you've seen The Ring?  That's what happens when a Japanese movie goes really successful - they remake it so that Americans won't have to watch Asians in leading roles.  Hollywood thinks we can't handle that and that subtitles make Americans cry.  They don't, but Hollywood wants to think they do (read the book 'Movie Wars: How Hollywood and the Media Control What Movies We See' for a long in-depth discussion of this kind of thing with regards to world cinema and twats like the Weinsteins). newlinechar  newlinechar There is a *LOT* of derivative crap.  A *LOT*.  The Grudge (Juon in Japan) was derivative crap that came long after Ringu and even Ringu was nowhere near first in the whole 'creepy little ghost girl with long black hair' thing.  If directors are making movies with pale jerky black haired girls with the intent of making bank in a Western market, they are failing miserably.  There are dozens of such movies cranked out every month from Japan and Korea (more Korea now), and pretty much all of them are ignored, even in circles that follow Asian cinema.  The groundbreaking Asian stuff is definitely not being made for a foreign audience - a lot of it COULD NEVER come out for Western audiences.  Battle Royale isn't licensed for distribution in America and probably never will be.  The subject matter would get uptight housewives losing their mind.   newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, that movie that won an Oscar, The Departed?  That was a ripoff remake of a Japanese movie called Infernal Affairs.  If the people who made Infernal Affairs did it to get their movie recognized in an American market, they failed pretty badly... they scrubbed that movie of almost all eastern influences.  Not sure if they did a competent remake, I didn't see it.

Xbox Live from Microsoft makes sure that every game developed for their service is vetted through their 'portfolio management' group of nazis.  Sony has similar plans for PSN and exorbitant prices to even start developing for their platform.  Nintendo just ignores anyone who isn't Japanese.  Steam on the PC side takes massive chunks of revenue and has a high bar of entry as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The companies that currently provide, or are providing in the next few years, an online distribution infrastructure that could enable such a market if they would simply ALLOW it, are crippling their services.  They know this is going to cost them money.  They have seen YouTube.  They have seen all of the online ventures that only benefit from openness, and yet they still close off their systems.  Also, if you talk to anyone involved in the game development business you quickly learn that it is a very insular and hierarchical group with elevated aristocrats lording over a sea of peons expected to work 100 hour weeks for months on end to crank out another movie licensed megabudget hunk of turd for an uberpublisher.  For small game companies the goal is to be cannibalized by one of the uberpublishers.  No one can really speak up because it is so easy to get 'black balled' if you don't 'play the game'.  And don't get me started on how far the dying retail market will go to put the stop to any of these online distribution models.

Very worrisome. Paul is not a libertarian. Or, rather, he is a one of those special American breed of libertarians, those who support an intrusive powerful government, but only on a state level. There was, at one time well over 100 years ago, a legitimate debate over the appropriate power of the various levels of government. For a variety of reasons, perhaps some structural, the states rights party melded into the racist bigot government control party. For a very long time 'states rights' has been a code word for keeping the nigger down and upholding the power of rich white males. It might not have to be that, but it is. Paul talks Constitution and freedom, but his actions are in close step with the white southern racists in trying to keep the feds out.

For things like taxes, estates, Hospital Proxies, anyone gay or straight should be able to designate a partner as that legal entity - no overhead or forced law.

The girls have been missing for ten years.  When they found Shawn and Ben, the cops looked at Devlin for a while, but after extensive interviews, they concluded that he had no sexual interest in girls and did not pursue him as a suspect.

The studies are all over the place in percentages (ranging from very high to very low), and the one that is cited most frequently for the prosecution (96% show no physical signs) doesn't even say that 96% of *abused children.*  Instead, it is instead *suspected abuse victims,* which includes children referred because their grades had dropped!

I guess that would automatically mean he had no access to young girls? :-| newlinechar  newlinechar It's not irrelevant if the person is attracted to young boys, but not young girls. The point of your post seems to be that pedophiles don't see a difference because children lack sexual characteristics. newlinechar  newlinechar However, that 'lack' is clearly objective (they're not developed sexually), and does not mean a pedophile necessarily does not view them differently, notice their differences, and even have the ability to subjectively prefer one to the other. newlinechar  newlinechar That has nothing to do with whether a pedophile has a preference for boys or girls, regardless of whether clinicians (currently) say he may or may not have adult sexual preferences.
I'll quote why, newlinechar  newlinechar 'Before the scientific discovery that human development begins at fertilization, English common law allowed abortions to be performed before 'quickening', the earliest perception of fetal movement by a woman during pregnancy, until both pre- and post-quickening abortions were criminalized by Lord Ellenborough's Act in 1803.[92]' newlinechar  newlinechar As an example of how things worked back then.
I don't understand your point.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I never said that autoboxing was bad, just that Java's implementation of it was. If they had done it the same way that C# did, we wouldn't have the kind of weirdness that the author mentioned. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The same goes with generics. Generics in Java are certainly better than no generic, but they could have been so much better. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As for type inference, the only question in my mind is how far do you go?
That's really interesting. So in that way, the Mac is a good platform for starting out as an independent developer; you can use the shareware model at first, reducing your initial investment, and then, later on, expand to other markets.
Wrong. The Loose Change kids never went to college. Korey Rowe had been discharged from the Army, and Dylan Avery couldn't get into college (poor grades) and was selling drugs prior to making the film. They were basically a couple of kids who had a little money and a lot of free time on their hands. Alex Jones does not make money directly from the film, but as a leader of the conspiracy movement he does have a vested interest in bringing in more believers.

Well, it's how he picked out his car.  Made sure it was an inline-4. Milage, seating, Price, craftsmanship, all the other qualities that will affect his life on a daily basis, those were set aside so a fact that will have the least impact on his life, or the lives of anyone he meets, will be totally fulfilled. I imagine he even has a bumper sticker on it, next to the pro-choice sticker, that reads 'I [heart] inline-4!'  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm VERY pro-choice.  But one issue voting is re-tar-ded.  newlinechar  newlinechar the chance of Paul or the government met being able to return the US to no-abortion land is ZERO. population limiting (birth control, abortion) is a fundamental tenet of modern, first world countries. If the citizens never had free access to abortions to begin with, then yea. There would be a good chance it would stay the same.  But we couldn't even keep booze away from the American people, I doubt they could do the same to anything as big nowadays.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, Even though I may not like his position on abortion, I will be voting for him.  And why he should too.  newlinechar  newlinechar There will never be a 100% good candidate, so take the best you can find.  ( Giant Douche vs Terd Sandwich anyone?)
&gt; This is not them simply being in denial; this is in terms of physiological responses.

That and having marble-sized balls didn't hurt either.

Not all children are mindless idiots who do nothing but drool on themselves while watching TV. While I certainly don't approve of it, there are ten year olds quite capable of willingly entering into a sexual relationship with full knowledge of what they are doing.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Before you start making pronouncements about what someone is or is not capable of understanding, you should do some research into what actually happened. Then, and only then, can you say what this particular girl did or did not know.
What a civil debate. How disorienting. I agree that nobody should be insulted for speaking correctly (even though our ideas about 'correctly' don't quite match up). In fact, I think it'd be a better world if fewer people harangued others about their language -- correct or not -- in the first place. 
I think that's the ideological equivalent of setting a small section of the school on fire, and then calling it a 'fire drill.'  That's seriously disturbing.  Did it make the news at all?

There's no reason in the world a high school student should have to make that kind of ethical call under that kind of pressure.

One Sunday, a priest asked one of the church janitor if he would cover his Confession shift for him -- he said it was easy, since he had a sin list inside the booth which listed both sins and penance. The janitor agreed and took the booth early on Sunday morning. Soon people showed up. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. I have committed adultery.' newlinechar  newlinechar 'Adultery, eh?' the janitor said. 'You sly devil. That'll be three Hail Mary's, plus five bucks.' newlinechar  newlinechar 'Thank you, Father.' newlinechar  newlinechar Another person came into the booth. 'Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. I have embezzled money from work.' newlinechar  newlinechar 'Embezzlement, eh? Naughty, naughty. That'll be 5 Hail Mary's, plus fourteen bucks.''Thank you, Father.' This was easy, the janitor thought. Another person came into the booth. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. I have committed the sin of oral sex.''Oral sex, huh?' He looked at the list, but didn't see oral sex there. So, he excused himself to look for help. He found an alter boy hanging out on the steps of the church. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Excuse me,' the janitor said. 'What does Father Matthew give for oral sex?' newlinechar  newlinechar 'Well,' said the boy, 'usually just milk and cookies, but sometimes a Snickers.'

We see how much respect Bush had for international law when he invaded Iraq, unprovoked. Not only would handing over more of our freedom to international committees fail to prevent wars of aggression by morality deficient US presidents, but it will make us subject to the wars of the international community.

We're slowly becoming nothing more than sheep to be herded around, but instead of fleecing us, they take our money via taxes.
well I thought the same - kind of shocked me once I realised. It does have some tricky special form rules to allow it, but essentually scala is 90% library implementation. which is really really powerful.  newlinechar  newlinechar Its much simpler grammar then java. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, '+' is a method (def).  So you can in fact have operator overloading (in a sense) except they aren't operators, they are just method calls.  newlinechar  newlinechar This works on objects which don't have the method on it by using an implicit def in scope.  newlinechar  newlinechar Really cool ! I just wish it would take off more. Part of the problem is its very heavily pushed from the functional angle, all the docs are in pdf and read fairly academically.

I'd guess by undermining it and inserting the trunks under it and then rolling it out of the shallow hole.

Well, my point was how a notion of how pervasive facebook is on college campuses.

i do believe someone was forced to watch while facebook raped his family. either that, or facebook used him for algebra homework but went out with the high school football captain instead.
Allow me to give you another perspective.  A good friend of mine dropped out of his degree with 3 courses left.  He went to work for Raytheon.  10 years later, he absolutely regrets not finishing his degree.  Not having the degree is constantly getting in his way even though he is very technically adept. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, if you want to work in another country you'll pretty much need a degree to get a work visa.  Within NAFTA, for example, you cannot get a TN visa (at least not legally) without a degree. newlinechar  newlinechar My degrees have opened so many doors for me and have made my professional life so much easier than I could have imagined.  If I were to do it all over again, I would do so without hesitation.
You can refine the rule further by removing Scheme and Java from it.
Pretty much, yeah. Because when the job interviewer meets a White person or Asian they tend to assume that they're competent, whereas negative stereotypes of Blacks and Latinos have permeated the American consciousness.

I'm not as libertarian as I used to be, and certainly not ancap.  I think it's unrealistic to think that any significant majority at this moment in history are going to approve of just opening the flood gates and allowing anyone and everyone into the country regardless of criminal background, education and or real skills.  I see the logic behind increasing the power of the federal government by increasing immigration laws, but really, why bother even having a country or Constitution.  The ancap dystopia isn't going to happen for another 30-40 years, imo.  I certainly think that eventually, nation-states as we know them will cease to exist and everything will just be small enclaves of people who have various ideologies in common, whether they be economic, cultural, religious, intellectual etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I also don't buy the argument that, well, in the 19th century (when we had _much_ less population and virtually no socialized infrastructure that people got dependent on), we didn't have immigration laws like we do now and there were record numbers of immigrants pouring in, therefore it would be exactly the same result now if we went back to that.  To make a fair comparison, you'd have to find a point in history when we previously had a massive state, immigration laws with little enforcing them and record numbers of illegal immigration, then switched suddenly to no federal government with no immigration laws and no borders.  If you profess the type of altruism that is implied by your statement 'enforcing immigration laws will result in more poor people dying because they will be unable to improve their economic outlook by moving to the US.', you ought to take a step back and think about the poor people in THIS country who to this day compete with people who are so desperate that they will clog the infrastructure we've all been paying taxes on all these years, not to mention the elderly who are already beginning to suffer from illegal immigration.  You know, nationals. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly, I will say that I don't care at all about poor people in other countries dying by not being able to move here.  At all.  I don't buy that neo-liberal crybaby bullshit and I think it's fake, contrived and is used as a sort of Godwin's law to guilt people into some twisted reason for you to believe their extremist concepts about people so disconnected to you you'd be more humane to consider the plight of the animals that are slaughtered for your food instead.  If it's so fucking tragic, why doesn't anyone in their country declare an emergency so people can at least declare refugee status and get proper care through the Red Cross, UNICEF and so on?  Next you'll be saying we should open the borders or else we can't save the children.  Think of the children!  More like, think of overpopulation. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Why didn't they rise up to replace Fox or the new guy or redistribute Carlos Slim's probably ill-gotten wealth?  If we're going to have a law, it should be enforced.  If it's not enforced, it sends a message that the law is to be circumvented if possible.  At that point, why bother having any laws at all?  In the meantime, it's not fair to the people who do follow them. newlinechar  newlinechar 
It is very common. The child slave markets were created by the missionaries. They profit off of it. In some cases, they even brainwashed the parents into thinking they were going to 'serve god' or be 'saved' and the corrupt govt does not do anything about it.. This was thier way of controlling the population. Lots of children are brought into this kind of abuse.. once they are old enough to walk they are sold off, and what is even more sickening, some regions, the parent's allow this to happen, becuase they are desperate. The whole situation is terrible over there and religion has made it worse.
WTF are you talking about?  He was telling you to go to IRC.
&gt; Most male pedophiles -- even those whom prefer boys -- are heterosexual; the sexual characteristics which arouse them are female. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you have citations to demonstrate this? newlinechar  newlinechar This source: http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html newlinechar seems to show that the data are spotty. One can conclude that pedophilia is *often* a separate preference from hetero- or homo-sexuality, but one cannot conclude that 'most male pedophiles -- even those whom prefer boys -- are heterosexual.'   newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, one study (Erickson, 1988) claims that 'Eighty-six percent of offenders against males described themselves as homosexual or bisexual,' but this study is dismissed by the  author of the page because it fails to differentiate between gay and bisexual offenders.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another study (Marshall et al. 1988) found that 14 of 21 offenders against male children were more aroused by female adults and 7 were more aroused by males.  So on the one hand, from this tiny sample you are correct that most male pedophiles that prefer boys are hetero; on the other hand, gays are over-represented at 1/3 of the sample relative to their 1/20 share of the population.

Thanks for the kind comment! Well, I'm not too sure about the price. Pricing is so much harder than coding that it's sick. newlinechar  newlinechar I described the pricing history in the comment above. I've always received about the same number of complaints about the price (few), and sales have grown more or less steadily. Many sales are from companies too. newlinechar  newlinechar Even if I'm totally positive that programmers don't like buying software tools, I nowadays tend to think that I'd be doing better at $99. I think we programmers err on the side of selling too cheap more often than  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also quite liberal with sending out discounts. Part of the thinking is that if the actual, real, only problem is the price, the person will at least drop me a line (some people do). Interested fellow redditors, feel free to drop me a line and I'll give you a nice discount. newlinechar  newlinechar Except for the support issues (which are a big burden for a one-man-band), I'd love to sell 4x as much at $29 - but I think it just wouldn't happen. I think most of the price sensitivity comes in the gap from $0 to $10, the jump from $10 to $79 only accounts for a few extra lost users.
or we could sit around on reddit organizeing a meetup of redditors to be trained into an elite fighting unit.
I understand you may be very busy. I didn't mean otherwise. I just think you should add that into the equation and do something to work around that, if you really want to find out how this works. newlinechar  newlinechar Step 1: forget game development as a possibility. I've been a game programmer for 10 years, you probably don't really want to go there, and for sure you don't want to go there on your own. It's not a good way to go independent. newlinechar  newlinechar Step 2 (this is an easy and enjoyable assignment): read every single post in Patrick McKenzie's blog [http://microisvjournal.wordpress.com/](http://microisvjournal.wordpress.com/). His tagline is: 'The schedule: 8 days. The budget: $60. The results: read on.'. He's now making about $2k a month, but only because he didn't choose a very juicy market.

Once it's done, put up a website and put it up for sale. Even if you end up selling just 5 copies, you will have learned so much that it'll be worth it.

My argument was based on the assumption that all possible gods will only reward worshipers, and punish atheists.

Captain Obvious, is that you?
No, he believes the U.S. has lost its way as a republic. One of the ways he wants to change it is to 'restore' religious values.  Which just means breaking down the federal system and bringing more power to the state level.  Once you've brought it to the state level, a lot of states would be free to decide, as an example, whether their schools should teach from the bible instead of current national school books.  And the really scary part, is that moving alot of this responsibility back to the state level is going to cause a very serious degree of infighting amongst the states on who now is responsible for what.

I've done a bit of both, and generally tend to work for large companies (contracting mostly) since I actually do end up making more money for my time that way than I have with any of my independent efforts.  The maximum earnings I can achieve this way is nowhere near I can achieve with a successful startup, but the loss of earnings with failed businesses can often be more than a stream of employment income.  In other words, if you can work smartly with your money while employed you can often turn out as wealthy as someone with a successful business.

&gt; The Environment would be fine in a free market. Nuclear power would at least be an option. It is powerful enough to meet all our energy needs without any greenhouse gases. newlinechar  newlinechar In a free market, the externalities of pollution and CO2 emissions would not be accounted for by the energy providers. It would be a cost on society which would not be internalized, and since it's not a cost *they* have to face, they don't seek to avoid it. Government action can work to internalize these costs by, for instance, taxing carbon.  newlinechar  newlinechar Nuclear power, along with other cleaner energies are simply not as cost-effective as some dirtier energies.  newlinechar  newlinechar 
I've never understood why this doesn't get more attention. RP would've used the Constitution (this year!) to make abortion murder in *every* state, if he'd gotten his way. The consequences of defining life as beginning at conception are enormous and totally not consonant with any sort of 'freedom agenda'.  newlinechar  newlinechar RP's HR 1094 bill would've turned blastocysts and zygotes into full-fledged American citizens under the Constitution, and anyone merely seeking an abortion into a potential defendant on an attempted murder charge, with its attendant multiple decade prison sentence. It would've empowered a new gang of 'uterus police' that would make the war on drugs look like a warm hug from an old friend.  newlinechar  newlinechar The kindest thing you can say about HR 1094 is that it is an incompetently, recklessly drafted bill... which, upon reflection, is simply inexcusable when the fact is taken into account that its primary author was a obstetrician and gynecologist.  newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I find this same kind of recklessness in his entire platform, but even if you don't, you're lying to yourself and others if you promote the notion that RP wanted to leave the matter of abortion to the states. He didn't. He wanted to make abortion murder in every state, and make embryos and blastocysts citizens of the United States.

'Starting your own business' and 'founding a startup' are different things. newlinechar  newlinechar Starting a one-man or small-group job shop or consulting gig is one thing.

Not by raising the standards in lands with low standards of living, but by punishing and starving nations who dare to regulate to establish a middle class at all. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Free Markets (and the libertarian fantasy economy) deliver teaming masses of abject poor and an elite. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Socalist and Communist theory was a REACTION to free market capitalism of the 19th century.

That's ephebophilia, not pedophilia.
nice link. I think it summarizes the points nicely for those that understand the problem. The difficulty though is explaining the problem to people used to the current system of federal regulation. The concept of limiting federal power is really a new and novel idea to just about everyone.

Also in a free market, the externalities of education would not be fully accounted for (I know, our education system currently sucks and they're not being properly accounted for now, but that doesn't mean that the way to fix it is to privatize). newlinechar  newlinechar In short, where there are significantly externalities to be accounted for, it should be the role of a responsible government to help account for them.

We are actually in agreement.  If you read through the second sentence I wrote, you'll notice that it implicitly acknowledges the Israeli Arab population (which is something like 1.5 million I think), but this is a minority of the total non-Jewish Arab population within Israel's current borders, even if you exclude the Gaza Strip.  Right now, there are tons of Jewish-only roads and housing developments in the West Bank even though the non-Jewish Arabs in that territory can't vote in Israeli elections. newlinechar  newlinechar I really do hope the two-state solution comes around.

Well, for clarity's sake, there is no monolithic HOR. The question is was any one doing this for political gain, specifically any Reps or anyone under the orders of a Rep. It's entirely possible that these guys wouldn't know an IP address from their own ass, much less think about the issue.

How do you define 'big'?  Ada is a general-purpose fully object-oriented programming language, ala C++ or Java.  A few years ago I read comparisons of Ada with other language in terms of keyword count and other naive measures of programming language complexity, but can't seem to locate any of them now.  Ada always came off favorably in these measures, which were undertaken mostly to counter the popular misconception that Ada was a complicated, unwieldy language. newlinechar  newlinechar You're free to review the [specs](http://www.adaic.org/standards/index.html) themselves and draw your own conclusions. After the initial release of 'object-based' Ada 83 there came the fully object-oriented Ada 95 and now the recently approved Ada 2005 standard. newlinechar  newlinechar Informally speaking, as one well-versed in the language, the specs and the language itself are well-designed, consistently defined, and with very few 'gotchas' that programmers have to be mindful of.
&gt; But the funny thing is most religious people give themselves outs, where all they have to do is pray, or believe Jesus died for their sins, or repent, and then they don't have to worry one bit about their responsibility for any of their actions. newlinechar  newlinechar Define 'most religious people.'  If you're limiting your claims to America, where Protestants are a clear majority religiously, then it might be true.  But the traditional (and still majority worldwide, these days) Christian understanding of justification is very much different than the view you describe: Christians must still suffer the temporal punishment for their sins, they simply aren't going to go to hell for them.

You assume the consumer market can afford more expensive chips. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Right now it's looking like 300 dollar home PCs soon to be 100 dollar home PCs. If you want to win this market you got to optimize, because you can't afford the losses from packing in new transistors that haven't been paid for upstream. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly world wide there's a much bigger sub $300 PC market than there ever was a $2000 PC market. And what's driving the $2000 PC market? Why that would be GPUs and software that takes full advantage of the GPU architectures. Intel and AMD are also rans in the high end PC market when determining the majority reason for purchase. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Eventuallys someone is going to get smart and realize that the vidoe game console market will subsidize the sub $300 PC market and at that point those whose software is optimized GPU architectures will make Intel and AMD irrelevant. That is if the CPU makers don't do something about this right now, by demonstrating their value in the only application that matters outside video games - the browser. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Since Microsoft killed off the shrink wrap market by suing Netscape, they essentially killed off software design economy that gave Windows it's dominant mindshare.

Especially when Ubuntu and friends run Firefox better, even without the CPU architecture optimizations. Do people really want to pay for Windows so they can run the DRM pooched Windows media player and use IE 7? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's all Microsoft could do to muscle the harddrive makers out of creating a network hard drive market, these last 3 years. Why pay 600+ dollars for a Windows Home Server, when you can buy a Buffalo network Drive for $175? If the home user is smart enough to use Windows Home Server, he/she is smart enough to run linux.

In your three years and a half at your college,  you could have added solid gold toilets as well and whatsnot if you had run a casino instead of a football team.  Gambling brings in more money than professional sport,  and when you own the casino,  you win every time,  unlike running a sport team.  Another side business in manufacturing and retailing recreational drugs would get you a lot more bucks too for a much lower investment. Not to mention the earning potential of all these cute young students who could turn tricks with minimum coaching. This would provide marketable skills to more students than just the few jocks that benefit directly for the athletic programs,  and thus more directly support the educational mission of the college. 
Subsidizing?  I think dave's point was the the coach's salary will pay for itself. newlinechar  newlinechar The coach wouldn't get paid millions of dollars unless lots of people were paying money to watch the football team.

&gt; I'm guessing the only reason the more sound approach wasn't taken was that it didn't provide the political benefits to Roosevelt, as it would have been decades before people would need to start drawing out funds. newlinechar  newlinechar At the time, Roosevelt and other New Dealers didn't forsee the huge population bust coming.  In those days, for every 14 citizens paying in to the trust fund, only 1 was being paid out to.  They didn't suspect we would contracept and abort away our workforce to the point where it was reduced to 3 paying in for every 1 paying out. newlinechar  newlinechar It's the same story in Europe.  Due to incredibly low birthrates, countries like Spain and Italy are required to have a certain amount of immigration into their countries each year just to keep the economy growing.

&gt; The problem is that if you raise capital gains tax, you reduce the benefit for people to invest in businesses that provide the goods and services we all use. newlinechar  newlinechar Sounds to me like economists doing a cost-benefit analysis on that would solve the problem (won't be easy, though). There is likely one or more optimal rates where the entirety of the costs caused by the two problems are minimized.
Citation needed for a pet theory?  plex has all but said, 'hey, this is an idea I think sounds good and I'm looking for evidence for or against.'  That doesn't mean it's claimed as true.  None of us can have personal hypotheses?  Or can we not mention them until we have hard proof?
Pricing software is hard. It's hard to find your break even point, and pricing it as a regular manufactured product is a lot harder because of production costs (which is where everything happens) and lack of distribution costs (internet download are virtually free--I say virtually, as I'm sure you pay for bandwidth). newlinechar  newlinechar If your main target is corporate teams, then it makes no sense to drop the price for the once-of type of customer (like me).  newlinechar  newlinechar I find it interesting, though, that the product does well for Visual Studio users and Windows users overall. Vi is (was?) part of the Unix world, and the Windows vim port is more for the nostalgic need to use vi--the first program I install in my Windows machines is the latest vim editor. Vi is a great editing tool, but new users think it too user unfriendly to give it a try. newlinechar  newlinechar Nonetheless, if increase in sales is what you need, I would start looking into typical marketing research to try to find out what people are really willing to pay. And if the individual consumer like me is not buying your product because of the cost.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think at $29, I would buy your product. The question is how many cheap-o developers like me are not buying at $79, but would be willing at $29. You will never know unless you do some research.  newlinechar  newlinechar You may be surprised at how many are out there, actually (unless you did research and didn't find that many). For starters, fresh graduates would be willing to buy it, I'd think. Most universities (good universities), use *nix based computing environments where vi and emacs are the norm. This demographic doesn't have the money to spend on 'cute' tools. On the other hand, it could be argued that these graduates are entering the corporate world and can influence their managers to buy your tool. However, they really don't have that much power to suggest spending on these things. Of course, recent graduates are part of the P2P generation and the concept of buying software is alien to them.

For that to be really efficient, you need to hoist the checks out of loops, so you essentially have duplicate code-paths specialized to the two possibilities (fixnum vs bignum), right?

What isn't covered, but what everyone should consider is this gives us more time to get the alternatives to a useful point.  There are a lot of interesting renewable projects out there.   If you have spare cash you should consider investing in them - you will then have energy as oil runs out. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course this is a bet on a decline starting about 2012 (or a little latter).   You have to consider the risks.   Some have claimed we can continue current production until 2070 (this is the most extreme I've seen).  The end of oil has been predicted within a few years since at least the 1880s (not 1980, 1880).

Nice link. i'll have to spend some time with that one. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree that equal right does not equal special rights - except when the language has to be explicitly written into standing laws. AND new laws written. Affirmative action being a prime example. Ideally there should be no need for this. But if there is a need, then gays should be included in the language. But then the business world will just have another government quota to meet - a forced quota that has nothing to do with the abilty of a gay being the best candidate. newlinechar  newlinechar I would like to see different implementation of affirmative action. I am not sure what and how, but maybe something along the lines of a better business bureau where complaints can be lodged for perceived discrimination and investigated instead of forcing a company to have a minimum of 3 gays, 3 non-whites, and one scientologist working for them. newlinechar  newlinechar Discrimination is hard. If I were a hiring manager, I might truly pick another candidate over a scientologist because I really have issues with my opinion of their intellect if they can believe in Xenu. newlinechar  newlinechar Thats my problem, not theirs. But the checks and balances of my discrimination has to come from within me - not forced by the government.

It's not quite that simple.  As mentioned below, scripts running on different pages can interact to some extent. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides that, there are typically resources within the browser engine that may need to be shared between threads to improve performance such as in-memory caches for images, scripts, pages, etc.  Interactions with browser plugins such as Flash or QuickTime may be another problem point.  Individual plugins would have to support being accessed on multiple threads.  As plugins have traditionally been accessed from the main thread, they may use mutable shared state without locking or may make calls into the OS that are unsafe when not performed from the main thread. newlinechar  newlinechar It's definitely an area worth exploring, but there are many barriers which prevent this from being as simple as 'just use one thread per page' like some people expect.

You’ve touched a very sensitive topic there.  newlinechar  newlinechar The current view is that *all men are created equal*.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is not a scientific view, but a personal, ethical (and indeed noble) view. Adherents to this view often reject any contrary views out of hand. This is similar to the way in which Religious fundamentalists stick to the *creationist view* and reject any evidence to the contrary.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are however several pieces of evidence that points out that there are differences between races (read populations).  newlinechar  newlinechar Why would two geographically separated populations follow the same evolutionary path? Yet we assume that everyone has the exact same innate abilities.  newlinechar  newlinechar An example is the [average IQ]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:National_IQ_Lynn_Vanhanen_2006_IQ_and_Global_Inequality.png) for different areas of the world. Obviously, race is not the only factor in the determination of IQ – cultural views, education and poverty. However, we should ask ourselves, how big a factor is poverty in the determination of IQ?  newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, there was discrimination against Jews (not only in the USA) for an extremely long time (cf. Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice). For instance, the Spanish inquisition was to flush out Jews in Europe. Yet they are on average more successful than European people – who were not the victims of discrimination.  newlinechar  newlinechar Why do Jews have such a disproportionate share of intellectual accomplishments? (Ludwig von Mises, Einstein, Sylvester comes to mind).  newlinechar  newlinechar I think that there is a lot of evidence that points out that people of Jewish and Asian descent probably has an average higher intelligence than European people.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are several questions I want answered before I will believe that the differences between races is superficial: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Why do Jews/Asians have higher average IQs than Europeans? newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Why are there that many rich Jews or Jews with Nobel prizes? newlinechar  newlinechar 3. Why do black people dominate athletics? Especially 100m, 200m. There are 1bn Chinese – yet they can not produce a decent 100m athelete.  newlinechar  newlinechar 4. Why is there a difference in performance of different races, even when they have the same education? newlinechar  newlinechar 5. Why is there a difference between the developments of countries – even when some of the countries were practically destroyed? (e.g. Japan after WW2, The rise of South Korea, The rise of China+India).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My personal view is that all persons should be treated equal – but there may be a difference in the abilities of different groups.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Sorry, I see some of the points were mentioned in the article.

I'm abivalent about 'hate crimes', but I think their advocates claim that such crimes are similar to terrorism. By lynching a black man in the South, the Klan hopes to terrorize all blacks into submission. Similarly, attacking a gay man because he's gay is usually an attempt to 'control' the gay population through fear. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Otherwise, why would a terrorist get a harsher penalty than anyone else for setting off a bomb? If we remove motivation from criminal laws, then terrorist would get the same sentence as any garden variety criminal. Are conservatives OK with that? newlinechar  newlinechar

1 milligram of actual conversion of matter into energy yes, but you need a fair bit more of the original radioactive material, since the vast majority of matter is conserved in a radioactive decay.  For instance, in tritium, one atom of tritium would give 2809MeV of energy if converted entirely to energy, but beta decay only gives off 18.6keV of energy (a ratio of about 150000).  So to get that 20W @ 5% for 12 years, you really need about 150g of material, which is still pretty good.  However, the power output of a radioactive source is not constant, since it is proportional to the number of undecayed particles, which (obviously) decreases in time.  
If you want to be literal, 'refactoring' would be more like changing the plants that line the road or renaming the exit; topics I fail to find interesting.

Yes, and when you are arguing within an established framework. You use the basic premise of that framework in your proof against it.

I never said that monads are only about IO. All you wrote is common knowledge. Monads are about constructing DSLs where statements are executed in an arbitrary order, chaining some value thru the invocations of those statements (which are implemented as functions of course). This can be used to do IO (the state contains the 'world' or holds some 'special' object), mutable state (trivial), 'nondeterminism' (the next statement is invoked multiple times or never) etc. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with monads and fp is that most programs needs some kind of mutation (at least for IO, but often for other things too) and instead of creating real functional solutions, monads are used to build an imperative sublanguage on top of the pure fp base and the real program in then implemented in this sublanguage. It doesn't really matter if you use unsafePerformIO  or a state monad: You've left fp-land and are back to imperative programming. newlinechar  newlinechar

The difference between the 1880 estimate and the 1960 estimate is one has a valid mathematical model (Hubbert Linearization) that has made valid predictions (the US 1970 peak oil output was predicted by it) and the other was just fearmongering based on the previous peak whale oil episode. newlinechar  newlinechar Since Megaprojects take several years to come onstream, a 2011-2012 total Peak Oil seems the most likely at this point. 4 years is hardly enough time to spend the trillions needed to retool our global energy supply.

I remember those rectifier diodes. They came in steel tubes (which I doubt stopped anything) and had 'danger: x-rays' printed on them.

Ah, so they just teach the propaganda that rainman spoke of. newlinechar  newlinechar The most important thing to grasp is that this was pre-ballistic missiles. The launch sites had to be in range of the target. Cuba posed a threat as the missiles were in range of Washington. newlinechar  newlinechar What they don't teach in America is that the US had just deployed missiles in Turkey that could reach Moscow. This gave the US the ability for a first strike, taking out Russia's heart before any retaliation was possible.  newlinechar  newlinechar Meanwhile, the US had been bullying and trying to assassinate Castro. They were funding terrorist groups to attack targets on the island and kill those they deemed enemies.

Also, memcpy has simpler requirements than memove (which is what BlockMove is), so its a case of comparing Apples to... erm... something non-appley. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The alignment issue (source operand not being 32-bit aligned) is irrelevant to the total running time. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;My plan was that if I always guaranteed that the source and destination addresses were properly aligned, then I could avoid all the special-case address checks and have a simple loop reading and writing 32-bits at a time. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In the case where he *guarantees* all addresses are aligned, he saves a single conditional jump (and a few dozen code bytes). The inner loop still copies 32-bits at a time, and the preamble is at most a handful of instructions where the source isn't aligned. This is just not worth it.

Divorce is not condemned in the Bible. Jesus said that divorce was allowable on the grounds of adultery (Matthew 19:9, 5:32). Any woman in Clinton's position, from a Christian standpoint, would have had suitable grounds for divorce. newlinechar  newlinechar In any case, I think porcelain was only pointing out that if one is irritated by whatever candidate's support of wifely submission, one ought to be irritated at Clinton as well, who apparently showed such submission (I would call it more forgiveness than submission, though). newlinechar  newlinechar By the by, as a Christian wife I would like to point out that I, personally, have no objection to a wife being in subjection to her husband (as outlined in the Greek scriptures). 'Subjection' doesn't mean 'slavery,' and it doesn't devalue the woman in any sense, any more than an employee being in subjection (in work matters) to his employer devalues him. The arrangement can be abused, however, and so if it's going to work it's important for both husband and wife to see it in the right way. The Bible does say that a wife is to be in submission and have respect her husband, but it also says a husband is to love and cherish his wife. It takes humility and respect for each of them. newlinechar  newlinechar I realize, of course, that folks interpret the Bible differently. In any case, there are certain interpretations that can work out quite well. :)

One flaw in the reasoning in this video is the idea that the planets are formed by impacts from small bodies that come from random directions, and all with the same momentum. The spin of the planets is because they are formed by collisions among smaller bodies that are already rotating around the Sun. Loosely speaking, they transfer their rotation to the forming planet. Of course, there is a degree of randomness in this, so a collision with a particularly large body, as you expect towards the end of the formation of the planets, can significantly alter the rotation rate and axis of a planet, at random. This would explain the anomalous rotation of Venus, or Uranus. It's interesting that we can observe this process happening around another star, Beta Pictoris, which is surrounded by a spinning disk of debris, and where a [violent collision](http://www.gemini.edu/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=117) between orbiting bodies has happened recently. newlinechar  newlinechar The four large moons of Jupiter (the Galilean moons) are thought to have formed together with Jupiter, out of a disk of material spinning around the planet, like the larger nebula spun around the protosun. They orbit Jupiter in the same direction, as expected. Other moons are small, irregular bodies, wandering planetesimals in fact, captured by Jupiter's gravity. These would have approached Jupiter originally from random directions, so they would not be expected to orbit the planet in the same direction.  newlinechar  newlinechar The statement that the gas giants could not have formed spontaneously because gas dissipates into space is ludicrous. The giant planets' gravity is quite sufficient to retain hydrogen atmospheres. The terrestrial planets, on the other hand, are much smaller and their gravitational pull is weaker, and they can't retain hydrogen. Mercury can't even retain any atmosphere at all. Our planets can retain thin atmospheres of heavier gases - fortunately for us! newlinechar  newlinechar The statement that the Moon's composition is very dissimilar to the Earth's is just plain wrong. In fact, the composition of the Moon is remarkably similar to the Earth's crust. The favored theory of the formation of the Moon is by an impact with a large body. [Computer simulations](http://www.swri.org/press/impact.htm) show how the Moon forms out of the debris ejected from the Earth by the impact. newlinechar  newlinechar The formation of the solar system is a fascinating story, built up from observations of the dynamics of planetary motion, analysis of meteorites, and of course more recently, exploration by spacecraft, and in the case of the Moon, by humans too. It's a much more interesting story than the creationist magical fantasy.

No, Dr. Clark was arguing that **segregation** was a **bad idea** and testified as such on behalf of the plaintiffs in Brown vs. Board of Education.  His results, of course, show the exact opposite.  Children in segregated schools had much more positive views of the black dolls than children in desegregated schools.

If the poor kid is that allergic he or she probably will have to segregate herself from normal society for the rest of her life.

In my experience it's that the instruments scale in difficulty differently. A guitar is easy to play a few notes on, but a massive shredding solo requires a lot of effort and skill just because of the way the instrument works. On a violin, it's way harder to play a few notes, but that same crazy solo is really not that much harder once you've got the basic skill down. The violin is made for rapid note changes like that. newlinechar  newlinechar Like most tools, you should use the one best suited and stop trying to argue which one's the best. :)

The original (before the change linked in this article) clearly stated that the requirement was a 'should' and not a 'MUST support' level.  My day job is writing software that is used in logo testing (for example, a certain trade alliance will allow you to put their logo on your packaging if you meet their requirements).  In general, specifications and guidelines have both mandatory and optional portions.  It is rare to find vendors who implement all of the optional yet recommended portions of the specification. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, as I understand it HTML5 will not have a formal logo testing program (since it is an open standard).  But the fact still stands that 'should' does not indicate something which is mandated for compliance with the standard, it is just a recommendation.

According to this article, it's not the finance wizards. It's the loan issuers.  newlinechar  newlinechar Loan issuers such as Countrywide Financial committed fraud.

Incidentally, the Danish name for New York's Statue of Liberty is Frihedsgudinden, meaning the Goddess of Liberty.

I don't think your comment deserves to be modded down.

Kansas City and Wichita property values are two entirely different things.

Why should open source implementations be left out with regards to audio or video due to the HTML5 spec using patent-encumbered audio or video codecs that won't be publicly usable for at least 15 years or more?  That would be plainly unfair to the free implementations that can't pay the per-user patent license fees.
And when the bug is in your vendor's mutex library, well, you're screwed.  What surprises me here is that they didn't require source code for everything.

Based on that list, the following are open video codecs: newlinechar * Dirac, still in development newlinechar * FFV1, 'FF video codec 1', an *experimental* codec included in FFmpeg's libavcodec newlinechar * Snow, another *experimental* codec in FFmpeg newlinechar * Theora, basically done (not very different from VP3), but libtheora is still in development. newlinechar  newlinechar So really, the best options here are either Theora or Dirac (unless FFV1 or Snow are ever finished; however, FFV1 and Snow are only implemented in an LGPL library and hence cause companies like Apple and Nokia to still complain about it).

&gt; He just doesn't believe in commercial software. newlinechar  newlinechar You mean *proprietary* software.  He's fine with commercial software, in fact [the FSF sell software](https://agia.fsf.org/order/) themselves.  You are mixing up two different concepts, and that is why [he recommends avoiding the term 'commercial software'](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Commercial). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; He doesn't want it to be used on open systems, he doesn't want it integrated in anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not about integration, it's about not supporting something he considers unethical.  The mixing isn't an issue, it's the mere fact that a distribution facilitates use of non-Free software that he considers a deal-breaker.  The end result is the same, but you have the motivation wrong. newlinechar

&gt;Just then, instead of facing the music, they step out of the conversation, and declare 'BS', a statistical lie, and so forth. newlinechar  newlinechar The only music to face is how big of a statistical lie these polls really are.   newlinechar  newlinechar These polls represent a severely skewed demographic who believes that if they 'get loud' their views will be spread.  How do they 'get loud'?  Here is one example:  they flood an online poll, all vote in a certain way, and then circulate these polls on sites like reddit and digg while they represent them as the gospel truth.  This happens almost daily on reddit (see any online Ron Paul poll for a citation).   newlinechar  newlinechar This behavior is both immature and self serving which is a big reason why the general public does not take these kinds of supporters seriously (see Ron Paul's non-internet poll results for a citation).
Ethics have nothing to do with law.  Law is an arbitrary set of commands made in order to alleviate a problem that may have existed at one time, but more often than not, that law becomes useless and often detrimental to society as a whole, so it needs to be broken. newlinechar  newlinechar This is about more than just sharing music.  It's about the outdated and broken intellectual property system that our country employs.  It's about freedom of the internet.  It's about fairness to consumers.   newlinechar  newlinechar You don't have to break the law if you don't want to, but don't call those of us who do 'unethical'.  newlinechar  newlinechar ...and, by the way, I *don't* pirate music, but I don't buy it either.

That is a great point. I don't know exactly where Ron Paul was back then on those issues. But here is what I do know, I voted for Bush in 2000, and looking back that was a huge mistake.  I was just a kid and was brought up in a sheltered, social conservative environment where you did not question conservative politics. My modern positions are radically different from those I once held. People shouldn't have static ideas, they should be adjusted as new evidence presents itself.   newlinechar  newlinechar As for this election cycle, I support Ron Paul, Kucinich, and Obama in this contest. I think any of them would generally move America to a better direction. They are all very critical of the government/business collusion. I just bring up Ron Paul here because he does tend to have a lot of reddit support and he does seem to be critical of the establishment that is poisoning democratic debate in America. newlinechar  newlinechar Ron Paul may have supported Reagan's policies, but I suspect this support wasn't universal. Anyone know exactly where Ron Paul stands on clandestine intelligence operations? For sure he seems to be against foreign entanglements in general and I'm confident this would include supporting puppet governments, funding contras, and supporting coups. newlinechar  newlinechar

Exactly. All those 'anti-war' lefties aren't really anti-war, they are lefties, democrats, anti-right and anti-republican. newlinechar  newlinechar They like to demonstrate and complain against the war, but given the opportunity to actually end it, other things come first: Abortion, national health care, strong federal government, freedom from religion, opposition to intelligent design and, most of all, staying in power. newlinechar  newlinechar Why don't they just admit it? Peace is way down on their priority list. newlinechar  newlinechar Sometimes I think that the **only** reason they are against the war is because Bush and the republicans started it. They probably would have been staunchly pro-war if a democrat had started them.

It's a combination of the two.  In Perl, the code would have worked, because Perl doesn't overload + for string concatenation.  + always means numeric addition in Perl, so the strings would be coerced to integers and added as expected. newlinechar  newlinechar The second case is also an artifact of the specific coersion rules.  Once again, Perl would have been just fine, because coercing an object to a string is fast in Perl (it doesn't serialize the whole object).

You're saying that a **recession** is when growth stops, but doesn't fall? That doesn't even make sense, the word recession coming as it does from the word **recede**, which means 'to diminish'. A depression is a much more severe recession - for example, where the GDP declines 10% or more. You can have a recession without growth stopping, and you can have one where growth falls, but it's not a depression until it falls very steeply and far (and you can have a depression without contraction).

That means that anywhere from .2% to .7% of the population is homeless.  That means that 99.3% to 99.8% of the population has a home.    Most, if not all, of those homes have electricity and running water.  A vast majority have TV, cellphones, cars, and internet access.

In my view they did try to increase liquidity, but with no faith in the banks the fed couldn't do it.  The same thing could happen again this time.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This is also from the Wikipedia page, quote from Marriner S. Eccles (a chairman of the Federal Reserve): newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;...Had there been a better distribution of the current income from the national product -- in other words, had there been less savings by business and the higher-income groups and more income in the lower groups -- we should have had far greater stability in our economy. Had the six billion dollars, for instance, that were loaned by corporations and wealthy individuals for stock-market speculation been distributed to the public as lower prices or higher wages and with less profits to the corporations and the well-to-do, it would have prevented or greatly moderated the economic collapse that began at the end of 1929. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The time came when there were no more poker chips to be loaned on credit. Debtors thereupon were forced to curtail their consumption in an effort to create a margin that could be applied to the reduction of outstanding debts. This naturally reduced the demand for goods of all kinds and brought on what seemed to be overproduction, but was in reality underconsumption when judged in terms of the real world instead of the money world. This, in turn, brought about a fall in prices and employment... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I am sure Ben Bernanke will write a nice book too when he's done, just like Alen Greenspan.

To most people, whether or not Joseph Smith was a con man is clear if you carefully review the evidence.  Most religions cover up any inconsistencies by telling you that you just have to have blind faith in certain teachings, and that you should not question them.  If you indoctrinate a child young enough into a belief system, that person can seldom see the world outside of what they are taught, no matter how obviously flawed.  Most of us accept things on blind faith outside of religion, such as the size of the earth, or even that there are other planets in the universe.  Most people haven't been to Mars, so they just accept that what they are taught about Mars is true.  This is based on provided evidence that seems rational and is provable, but more important is 'falseafiable,' meaning we could disprove it if it weren't true.  With most religions, however, the teachings are occasionally not rational and not provable, and never 'falseafiable', so it can't be debated.  You either believe it or you don't.

&gt;Are you suggesting that while it is possible to use 'creative accounting' to invent false gains for one purpose, it is somehow not possible to create paper losses for another purpose? newlinechar  newlinechar No, I am not suggesting that. I should be more precise. Enron didn't make their losses 'disappear' completely, they just hid them in other financial statements that no one was looking at, but they were still there. newlinechar  newlinechar So from an accounting perspective, to be more precise, you cannot just delete losses, or input gains into your financial statements. You could of course technically write in incorrect figures, but they ultimately must be backed up by some real world evidence, such as receipts and bank account balances. You cannot create or destroy income or losses through accounting; however, through creative accounting, you can determine to which accounts and at what times those transactions apply. newlinechar  newlinechar The dispute with Paramount Studios is difficult to delve into, but Paramount wasn't getting any free lunch per say. They cannot just create expenses without having the records of the transactions to prove it. newlinechar  newlinechar What they did is take losses that should be applied to other parts of businesses and apply them to that individual production so as to make that production unprofitable. In terms of the whole company however, they have not created any losses. The same amount of losses, companywide, would have been recorded regardless of what production they are applied to. So Paramount did not create losses or destroy income; they merely moved it from one business project to another. newlinechar  newlinechar That isn’t to say that Paramount couldn’t take money out of their bank account and then fabricate receipts from companies that they supposedly purchased services from, but such an action is not in the realm of creative accounting. That is straight up fraud. newlinechar  newlinechar The distinction probably seems trivial, but it is not. newlinechar  newlinechar So what is the purpose of accounting, how do you determine if the particular accounting procedure is correct, and how do you determine if it is illegal? newlinechar  newlinechar The primary purpose of accounting is simple: To provide information that is useful for decision making. newlinechar  newlinechar To determine if the procedure is correct, it must fulfill the primary purpose while being relevant, reliable, comparable, and consistent; among other things. newlinechar  newlinechar Determining if it is an illegal procedure in civil suits is a hairy web of agency relationships and contracts; that is why we have Judges. newlinechar

Thanks for your thoughtful reply. newlinechar  newlinechar First, I don't have any number to back me up (because I couldn't find a number anywhere supporting or refuting my claim) but you argued the number of guns in the US up to 96 guns per 100 people.  To equate it to our discussion here, we should be talking about the number of times someone has used their gun vs the number of times someone has used drugs. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, I don't have any numbers to back me up, but I'd be really surprised if you can show me numbers that back you up.  Or in other words, I bet there are more drug uses per capita than there are gun uses.  Proof to the contrary is welcome. newlinechar  newlinechar But even if I am wrong about that, I still maintain that guns are a self fulfilling prophecy.  As long as everyone around you is armed to the teeth, there is quite the incentive for you to do the same.  A civilian arms race is not exactly a recipe for a caring, understanding society. newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree with you about my national nuclear weapons question, but that is just my opinion.  You are consistent with your logic (national vs personal weapons) so I can't fault you there, even if I disagree with you. newlinechar  newlinechar Would you advocate every individual having nuclear weapons?  Why or why not? newlinechar  newlinechar And to your 'shootings in malls, schools, and churches' example - as long as guns are legal in some places but not in others, then yes, your prophecy with fulfill itself.  Crazy people will be able to easily get guns in one place and use them in another.  But I suggest that the better situation overall is not to have everyone armed but to arm no one. newlinechar  newlinechar I live in downtown Toronto (joked as the only Canadian city with real hardcore American style crime) and I've never once been afraid of being shot.  I think I've seen one gun in my life - a rifle at my father's friend's farm when I was a kid.  I've never known anyone who was shot or even shot at (outside of people in the military).  We are safe in Canada not because everyone is heavily armed, but because (by and large) no one is.

It is true that abortion would kill the baby.  It is also true that a miscarriage, which can be induced by certain types of exercise in some cases, will kill the baby.  Would you then say that someone who exercises and miscarries is guilty of manslaughter?  What about someone who knows that they are likely to miscarry, and exercises for that reason?  Further, if you believe that a baby has full personhood, may the baby be evicted by the mother?  If not, is her womb some sort of public property, that she does not have control over?

&gt; You act as though having many old theories replaced by new theories is something unique to economics, when this is actually how the scientific method works. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But unlike economics, our basic understanding of physics is not changing every 10 years or so. Also, the predictive nature of science allows us to do things like put a man on the moon without relying entirely on trial and error. Economic theories are typically useful in understanding and anticipating markets whose members subscribe to the same theories.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It is also important to realize the the formal study of economics is relatively young, and is still growing. It's a bit unfair to compare it to physics, which is arguably the oldest science. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I had been wondering if you could say that economics was simply a primitive science and analogous in some ways to say, alchemy. Even if that were true, we obviously shouldn't base national policies on this kind of theory any more than we should turn the courts over to witchfinders. But we do have economists, who might just as well be reading tealeaves half the time, with huge influence  on government, business and the markets. Russia is an example of a country whose economy was pretty much ruined because they listened to the prescriptions of experts pulling just such a confidence trick.

Speaking of Junk Science, Wikipedia has a pretty good article about the topic:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_science newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I couldn't find anything about it at Britannica Online, though.
Sorry to burst your bubble, but [no](http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams/msg/d1064f7b27808692): newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do' I typed it out. End of story. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Still, it's a fascinating story, and an astounding coincidence. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar *Edit: I just saw a brilliant [pair of comments](http://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=181396&amp;cid=15002803) over at Slashdot.

I think ordering comments by points is a good thing, because the quality comments and ongoing discussions are the ones you get to read first, while pointless or bad comments sink to the bottom of the page. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's true though that it's hard to find the new comments on coming back to a large comment section. But ordering threads by seniority won't fix that since a new comment may have been added to an old thread. I guess the 'flat' unthreaded ordering is the only solution to that, though I've never used it myself. Or maybe an option to colour-code the comments by freshness? (A fading yellow highlight behind the '*n* hours ago' text won't look so bad)

I know that the net is just another communication channel. newlinechar  newlinechar So, I'm saying that this situation is a great example of how net communication can have serious, real-life impact, and should be remembered as proof against lulzer dismissal.

What you propose is still not good economics.  It is the moral equivalent of giving the poor free bread as they tried to do in Roman times.  In the movie Gladiator, they made it look like such a noble thing, but in real life, the problems started when the farmers came looking for their free bread. newlinechar  newlinechar Giving the poor money would only create runaway inflation, as was the case in Chile before Augusto Pinochet came to power, backed by the greatest economic team ever assembled. newlinechar  newlinechar The better way to help poor people is not to give them money but to create conditions whereby people help themselves when they help society - in a monetary, not karmic sense.  When social rewards for helping society are only of the latter - not former variety, THAT is bad economics and the fundamental failure of socialism.

'Those improvements' are my property to do with as I please. *Allowing* Daniel J. Bernstein access under the GPL does not prevent him from using it. And if I decided to devote my time to another piece of software instead, Daniel J. Bernstein would still be 'denied' the fruit of my labor. newlinechar  newlinechar This particular discussion is interesting because Bernstein himself distributed qmail without a license at all prior to this. The effect was in fact *more* restrictive than the GPL since he only allowed limited redistribution but not modification. So by his own previous standard, Bernstein has *more* access to a modified GPL'd copy of qmail than he gave others just a few days ago. newlinechar  newlinechar The only way to contribute was to release parallel patches, which are completely owned by their authors and subject to any (or no) license of their choice. Now Bernstein apparently wants to make distribution easier, but still advocates that people don't modify the program! Clearly, the man *doesn't want* anyone else's changes.

An interesting comment except for the logical fallacy and the 1/2 truth.  First the 1/2 truth, the Bible does not say that Adam and Ever were made 6,000 years ago-there is no such verse, the 6,000 year figure that young earth creationists bandy about comes from trying to calculate the number of generations of people going back to Adam and take accounts at face value and add these to come up with the age of mankind.  4 false reports are not evidence that a very different 5th report is also false.  You could have a dozen false reports of human cloning or sustained fusion on earth but you wouldn't be able to reject all subsequent claims as false because the preceding ones were false.  Anyway, as for the Q'ran vs. the Bible, any decent scholar will tell you (if s/he isn't afraid of the backlash) that the Q'ran is a pathetic mish mash plagiarim that attempted to fuse elements of the prevailing pagan rituals with those bits Mohammed understood poorly from Judaism and Christianity.

&gt; It seemed like the OP had as his goal to reduce the impact of Christian aggression in the region or to defray the blame onto the Muslims. newlinechar  newlinechar The Crusades were defensive wars.  The extent of Muslim conquest at this point in time was Spain, North Africa, Palestine, and parts of Asia Minor.  At one time, it had part of France on its list, and it would go on to add  all of Asia Minor, and southeast Europe. newlinechar  newlinechar This was not the periphery of Christian lands.  This was its very heart.  To call the Crusades 'Christian aggression' is a bit disingenuous, I think. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, my point was to demonstrate that what occurred in Jerusalem that we are calling an atrocity now was a status quo *law of war* in that era. newlinechar  newlinechar The same cannot be said for atrocities committed the last century by atheistic regimes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Both Muslim and Christian sources say that Jerusalem was a mass slaughter, so perhaps the nature of it was embellished, but the basic fact seems to be pretty much consensual. newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps.  It seems there were no firsthand accounts of the event, and most of the texts describing it were authored years later by people who weren't even there. newlinechar  newlinechar Cf: http://www.americanoutlook.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=article_detail&amp;id=1474

You mean facts like the [NAFTA Superhighway](http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070827/hayes)? or the [Amero](http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/amero.asp)?
see this is where I get confused.  newlinechar  newlinechar what is the purpose of a salt if the salt is stored next to the hashed password? newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, the worry here is that someone somehow breaks into a system and sees a users md5 hashed password. If the hash is unsalted, then the attacker may have a pre-existing dictionary of all of the english words hash values and find that the user's password is 'apple' relatively easy. newlinechar  newlinechar With a salt, the 'apple' string gets turned into something like 'HSeR5apple' before it's hashed, and that salt of 'HSeR5' is stored along side the hashed password in a db somewhere.. right?  newlinechar  newlinechar So the attacker gains priveledged access to the data and finds a hashed password and a salt of 'HSeR5' stored along side it in the record.. that sucks for the attacker, because his pre-established hash dictionary of the english words is no good.  newlinechar  newlinechar However, the attacker can make a new dictionary with every english word from the old dictionary now prepended with the compromised salt value, build that hash table, and do a lookup.  newlinechar  newlinechar So, the obvious advantage of the salt is that the attacker will have to do some work to find the original password, and if each user has a unique salt then the attacker has to go through that work for each password they want to figure out. So with a herd mentality, the average user is statistically kind of safe.. but if the attacker is only targeting one user then is the salt still pretty safe? newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously the salted hash is safer than just storing the straight hash of 'apple', but I guess what I'm wondering is, does it take a considerably amount of time on modern computers to build out a md5 hash table of say 200,000 entries (Assuming 200K english words prepended with whatever salt is found for the user who's being attacked)? newlinechar  newlinechar It seems like if the hash is compromised, the attack is somewhat trivial, because the salt will likely also be compromised, correct? Or does this salting protect against something I'm not aware of? Are people doing MD5 client side before sending it over the wire or something? Perhaps my assumption that the md5 happens severside before persistence is the flaw in my understanding here..?

Perhaps at that age. But preferably you want to have a thing called 'savings', and not just of the retirement variety. You also want to be confident in your own skills and employability, whatever that takes. newlinechar  newlinechar You'd be amazed how empowering those two things are. And when you're empowered, you tend to make more money and be less stressed. newlinechar  newlinechar The moral of the story is: Start saving your damn money, it's a lot more important than buying a new computer or an extra $100/month in car payments or all the other luxuries that people tend to bog themselves down with. And then make sure you're the best you can possibly be at whatever it is that you do. newlinechar  newlinechar You should never be worried about losing your job. I'm not. I used to be, but not anymore. At my old job I got a letter of reprimand for a bullshit reason (after working almost 30 hours, through the night, to fix a few extra bugs before we went gold, they were angry that I left two hours early the next day to go home and sleep) and my two weeks notice was on my manager's desk the following morning.
It's definitely getting better. newlinechar  newlinechar Now we need a [religion] subreddit.  Seriously, if you look at the front page right now (without [politics]) there are at least 5 if not 10 religious (atheism, catholicism, christianityism [why not?])  What if we don't care for that? newlinechar  newlinechar They REALLY need to get the ball rolling on tagging, which is _supposed_ to alleviate all these woes.  I have a sneaking suspicion that a) they're finding tagging WAY harder to implement than they thought and/or b) [their implementation of] tagging isn't as effective as they thought.
it is a stump speech - that's not being contested.  no one can show what they will do as president before they are president. newlinechar  newlinechar the only thing we can do is evaluate the campaign, the lives, the character, and the policy positions of the candidates.  Obama's campaign has been substantiative, but more, it has been a 'process-oriented' campaign.  politicians love to promise what they will accomplish - but they cannot accomplish many things on their own. newlinechar  newlinechar by running a 'process-oriented' campaign, Obama is focusing on promises he can keep, by explaining how he will do things and what procedures he will institute as president.  his transparency initiatives are a great example.  he doesn't need Congressional approval to make executive branch actions more transparent (even arguably to make Congressional ones too - though he is one of the sponsors of a bill to this effect now), and this accomplishes an important procedural objective - making information more accessible which theoretically leads to a better informed public. newlinechar  newlinechar Clinton and most of the rest of the candidates promise specific things like health care; Obama has a specific and substantive health care plan as well (like Edwards, Clinton, Giuliani, Thompson, and McCain).   newlinechar  newlinechar you really cannot say that any of the major candidates 'lack policy' - they produce policy papers on many issues.  the questions are: what are they hiding?; will they be able to accomplish these goals?; how will they do so? newlinechar  newlinechar Clinton makes a fetish out of never discussing how she will do anything, focusing instead on her goals.  Obama makes a point of discussing his thought processes, his approach, and the goals, as if all were important.
(IHIHNBT...) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And yes, as soon as a project is released to the public domain, the smartest thing to do is put it in a GPL wrapper from which all further development should proceed. newlinechar  newlinechar This is meaningless.

I am willing to believe that history is for the most part inaccurate and biased, but what is peculiar to our own age is the abandonment of the idea that history could be truthfully written. In the past people deliberately lied, or they unconsciously coloured what they wrote, or they struggled after the truth, well knowing that they must make many mistakes; but in each case they believed that 'facts' existed and were more or less discoverable. And in practice there was always a considerable body of fact which would have been agreed to by almost everyone. ... It is just this common basis of agreement, with its implication that human beings are all one species of animal, that totalitarianism destroys. ... The implied objective of this line of thought is a nightmare world in which the Leader, or some ruling clique, controls not only the future but the past. If the Leader says of such and such an event, 'It never happened' — well, it never happened. If he says that two and two are five — well, two and two are five. This prospect frightens me much more than bombs — and after our experiences of the last few years that is not a frivolous statement.'  newlinechar  newlinechar

Thanks for the link to the text. An impressive statement, and I agree with it. The contrast with the US of today is really staggering. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it all boils down to media control. Media control translates to mind control of the masses. I found some [statistics](http://www.csun.edu/~vceed002/health/docs/tv&amp;health.html) about TV-use in the US. In contrast to idealistic notions of long ago, a TV-set that plays prevents independent thought and discussion, with few exceptions. In theory that need not be, and there are some programs well worth watching of course, but in practice it works out that way. This is used on purpose, to exert control over what happens in a democracy. newlinechar  newlinechar The effect of all this is devastating, as any person still thinking can see.

They're not trying to win an award for creativity, they're trying to provoke a response so that people might actually think about their work environment and realise how dangerous some things in them that we take for granted actually are.
Yes, i find it remarkable how often i come across papers originating at MSR when doing something with computer vision. There are obviously some very bright people living there.
tohu vavohu
agreed! as with anything else in life...most people that are bad at something rarely actually admit it, not to someone else but to themselves.
You are not a cryptographer. To a cryptographer, something is 'broken' when it can be attacked faster than bruteforce. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, DES was never broken in the first place. It simply has too short a key to be secure any longer. However, In the experience of cryptographers, once you find a real weakness in an algorithm, it can quite often be improved with further work.
Yeah? Try the fashion business.
I sometimes like Chris Rock's humor, but if he's actually having a significant influence on this race we're already screwed.

He's getting money from fanatical supporters, not the general population. That's the difference. Paul's numbers will never significantly go up. His policy positions are absurd to most americans. newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong: vote for whoever you like. But he is what he is. And most Americans discount him as soon as they hear he wants to do away with public education, allow infinite numbers of illegal immigrants in, and do away with what little government healthcare we have.
Then how do you explain the probing? newlinechar  newlinechar Will someone please think of the probing!!!
But their chosen padding would likely never spell anything. Let alone make any kind of sense to a reader. If they just made each document 'The winner is: &lt;candidate&gt;' then a plain text document would be properly salted.

It's fair enough to say that when there are rioters calling for the execution of a teacher who 'offended Islam' imagine if a Sudanese teacher came to England and named a teddy bear Jesus, we would most certainly not be calling for their death. Islam and the West are diametrically opposed.
&gt; Does this constitutional reform increase the number of instances in which the above clause may be used? newlinechar  newlinechar As I understand it, no.

I did know about the Treaty of Tripoli, thanks.  I disagree about it being the only place I could see him damaging the republic- I could also see him continuing many policies akin to those of Bush: putting ideologues into positions of power over federal agencies such as the FDA and EPA, weakening all kinds of environmental and consumer protections, and similar such policies. newlinechar  newlinechar If you aren't already familiar with him, I would recommend anyone who likes Paul's libertarian (not Libertarian) ideas look into Mike Gravel. He's just as much in favor of liberty and controlling government spending, but without any of Paul's Libertarian insanity.  newlinechar  newlinechar A link to some of Mike Gravel's stances: http://www.ontheissues.org/Mike_Gravel.htm
Don't complain about people misusing relatively obscure words while doing likewise with very simple ones yourself.

Have you ever flown between two big trees?  It really doesn't seem that far fetched.
Individuals making up a group *may* want to maintain their position of power (though in the case of american whites, I think it's generally not the case). But each member of the group has individual incentives not to do this. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a classical tragedy of the commons. Helping your group is a 'public' good (with 'public' restricted to mean 'only white people', 'only women', etc, not the public as a whole). Helping the group may mean hiring only whites, dating only whites, etc. Helping yourself means hiring the most qualified person available, dating the most beautiful women available, etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar Most people will perform the selfish acts, unless there is some external force that will punish them for doing so. newlinechar  newlinechar It's much like environmental regulation. Collectively, we want clean air. But an individual factory owner has the incentive to pollute more since it will earn him money.  newlinechar  newlinechar (Note: Before anyone accuses me of it, I'm not saying that hiring a black person is morally equivalent to polluting. I'm saying it's economically comparable, in the sense that it is a selfish act that harms the 'public', with 'public'=='white people'.) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The rich, a group made up of rich people, do this every time they vote for bogus 'trickle down economics.' newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure that's actually true. newlinechar  newlinechar Voting is funny business. Most people vote not because they want to affect the outcome, but because of how it makes them feel about themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar This is why many rich people (NYC, Boston, hollywood) vote for left wing types who will raise their taxes. Their vote doesn't matter, but at least they feel good about themselves.
That's why people believe in evolution today, because it seems to explain a lot of stuff that they can see, but doesn't address challenging questions like biochemistry.

Again, you can't technically relicense BSD'ed code (I don't know much about the X11 or MIT licenses). But if I distribute BSD'ed code under another license, and someone doesn't like the terms of my license, they can just go to the original copyright holder and get the code from them. You can only re-license modified versions of the code.
No doubt, but people act as though the Chinese own like 80% of our debt, and that's just spreading misinformation. We have bigger problems than the money we lend out to foreigners.
No, not at all. I merely said sex that results in pregnancy shouldnt be terminated for the sake of inconveniance. Have sex, as much as you want for all i care but realise that it can result in unexpected consequences which cant just be shrugged off. It's not about sex, it's about the value you place on pregnancy. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, why is it a woman should be allowed to have an abortion despite the fathers wishes, yet the father often has to provide financial welfare when he refuses to accept the child. Double standards?
&gt; Also, DES was never broken in the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar What about the well-known differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis attacks against single-round DES? DES's boxes were chosen to be resistant against differential cryptanalysis, but it isn't immune; and the linear cryptanalysis attack, while not practical (it requires a huge number of known plaintexts), is nevertheless a 'break' in the sense you defined. newlinechar  newlinechar And then there are of course meet-in-the-middle attacks against 3DES, but that isn't DES proper.
I don't think he was talking about a knife.
Yes, but it also makes them more likely to not report or ignore evidence that does not agree with its agenda.  Perhaps a more neutral link should've been provided, not one so clearly fraught with bias.
An *airplanebook* would be a book about planes although, in the right context, it could be used to mean the latter just as well. newlinechar  newlinechar And I said 'no' because I didn't actually mean compound words but the practice of compounding words.

We have to give them a reason too. It's self defeating to just bemoan the media. You gotta use that to rally people, not placate them. A win in NH would be awesome, but if we can just beat Giuliani or Romney, that will be news worthy.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm guessing it will probably be Giuliani getting beat, since Mitt has a house in NH, governed Massachusetts and the like. 
Making fun of windows is a meme that propagates through installing windows on computers. newlinechar  newlinechar The meme is only expressed when a human uses the computer with windows and therefore starts making fun of it. newlinechar  newlinechar But I guess no one would install windows without having heard of it, so I suppose that makes windows a meme that propagates using humans but is only expressed on computers :)
The resistance wouldn't come from the Sunni Muslim countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE etc... it would come from Shi'ia militias in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and so on. More importantly, Iran is a major economic ally to both China and Russia so war against Iran is much more serious than many anticipate.
That was you? newlinechar  newlinechar Thank you, it's so peaceful here now.
Well, I read it and I'm glad I did. People need to research before they take the word of just any dufus who claims to know something about Islam. They're not even getting the difference between the Qur'an and other texts of Islam. If they can't do that, then everything they say is suspect. newlinechar

It could always be some comedy show parodying Millionaire. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it's real, though. Not like I've ever watched French TV, but I'd expect more of a laugh track if it were parody.
For the sake of context, I'm essentially Diest in my 'religious' leanings, but nevertheless hold the view that human rights must be taken into account for an unborn fetus. I also am the father of 2, and just learned that my wife is pregnant (a big surprise, unplanned) in our mid-40's, so this issue of abortion is very very prevalent to me. FWIW, we'll be welcoming the new child into our family, despite having to adjust alot of future plans. newlinechar  newlinechar I think an essential point to consider in this matter is 'natural development'.  newlinechar  newlinechar A sperm or an egg, or  an arbitrary bundle of human cells, will not develop on their own into a mature human being as a natural course. A fetus, from the moment of conception onwards, will (usually) develop into a mature human -- insofar as the necessary environment, nutrients, etc. are provided for. newlinechar  newlinechar The same can be said for an infant that has been born. If one does not provide the necessary environment, including nutrients, shelter, etc. to a newborn infant, or even an older child, it will not survive. Its natural development will cease. newlinechar  newlinechar The equating of a fetus to 'just a bunch of cells' misses (or deliberately avoids) this key, even pivotal, point. newlinechar  newlinechar This period of natural development begins at conception, not at some later point in time, although there is a recognized point in that development when an external environment can be provided by medical staff sooner than is normal. newlinechar  newlinechar This whole debate, to me, centers around whether a women can be required to provide the necessary environment (i.e. her body/womb) for a fetus to naturally develop to that point of maturity when the responsibility for a sufficiently sustaining environment can be transferred to another. newlinechar  newlinechar So, if one takes the view (as I do) that the unborn fetus has human rights from conception, since given the right environment it will (barring termination by act, disease, etc.) develop naturally into a mature human being, there is a conflict of rights between those of the fetus and those of the mother. Who's rights should take precedence over the other's? newlinechar  newlinechar Should the rights of the fetus to develop naturally trump the rights of the mother to decide whether to provide the environment for natural development. That's the question. newlinechar  newlinechar Saying that the fetus is 'just cells' is IMO just a convenient way to avoid the real question of rights of the fetus vs. rights of the mother. newlinechar  newlinechar Note that none of the above is based on any 'religious' view or belief whatsoever. newlinechar  newlinechar Note also that I don't advocate above any specific position on whether the rights of the fetus always trump the rights of the mother -- I'm just arguing that (a) a fetus has rights from conception and (b) the debate is about conflicting rights; how the balance of rights is decided is then a legal issue which depends on alot of factors, no different from any other conflict of rights between individuals.

Apottedficus, newlinechar While it's true the ladies look more European - I actually spent a great deal of time matching clothing styles and had some success linking them to the 16th century - it may be that the artist was European and the text was based on local dialects.  To answer you questions, it was common to encode exploration research the same way trade secrets are protected.  These explorers, in addition to looking for gold were also looking for spices, miracle cures, and anything else they might be able cash in on back home.  Since they could be robbed at sea  or have their findings stolen once they returned, they went to great lengths to guard their manuscripts.  You're right in assuming a thief might try to extract (through means that would make waterboarding look tame) the code to unlocking the text, but that would only be the case if the manuscript was recognized at the time it was stolen.  It is just as possible that it was lost in a trunk for years before someone found it - Schubert's 'unfinished' symphony for instance sat in a drawer for 40 years after his death before being discovered.  The history of this document shows that indeed there were those who hoped to sell it but they could not decipher the meaning and that hampered their efforts. Interestingly, it was finally sold because it was a mystery.  Starcharts. I'm not convinced they were for navigation.  To me at least, they seem to be more about astrology and religion than science.  I wish I had the resources to hire astronomers to work on this issue!  The idea that these are southern hemisphere stars is intriguing as well.   newlinechar  newlinechar I sincerely appreciate your efforts to shed light on this mystery and I think we both know this thing is not a hoax.  Do try to entertain the idea that it was from the new world and see where that takes you. newlinechar  newlinechar Cheers, GDT

So what action do you suggest a non-cryptographer looking for a strong cryptographic hash should take?
This is **exactly** why we *should* leave it up to the states - this is a *very* difficult problem, and to impose a single answer across 300,000,000 people is not only unwise, but borderline tyrannical. Dr. Paul has often said that for early term fetuses, it is very hard to decide about it's 'humanness' - but the current laws do not make any distinction whatsoever - even 30 seconds before it is born it is not protected from abortion. newlinechar  newlinechar As Dr. Paul, I, and many other believe, the harder the problem is, the lower and closer the decision should be pushed to the people. This gives people more power to make decisions based on how they believe, and allows more opportunities for better solutions to arise. newlinechar  newlinechar All that being said, I personally think Dr. Paul has a right to his anti-abortion position, being an OB/GYN and having to deal with the issue *first-hand*, which is more than you can say about any of the other candidates (AFAIK, none of the others are obstetricians)

&gt; You can say something along the lines of all Christians are intolerant warmongers and/or all Americans are uneducated morons and the reddit community votes comments like this up. This is a generalization they love. But make a crack about European women not shaving their legs and you're accused of being ... vapid. newlinechar  newlinechar What's so surprising about the fact that a lot of Redditors are educated Americans fed up with the fervent religiosity and stupidity of their countrymen? Every day, smart and educated Americans have to deal with their compatriots accusing them of being mischievous delinquents without any common sense or morality. Anti-intellectualism runs rampant. What's wrong with poking fun or expressing exasperation at this fact? Gotta blow off steam in a country where being smart is considered dumb, where people with Ph.D.s or other such degrees are viewed as maleficent wizards and practitioners of black magic.
At least caucus states are somewhat understandable.

&gt;His policy positions are absurd to most americans. newlinechar  newlinechar I think you're right.  But I think they think his positions are absurd because the MSM delivers the message that we need these programs.  If I had heard for 10 years that the department of education is a good thing (i did) and somebody comes out and says no its bad, I would probably think that was an extremist position. newlinechar  newlinechar Take the following two sound-bytes: newlinechar  newlinechar 'I want to fix the Education crisis in this country.' newlinechar  newlinechar 'The Education crisis in this country is the result of bureaucracy and to fix it I will rid of the Department of Education' newlinechar  newlinechar The second line delivers too much information.  Many voters never bother to do their research, so they don't care how the problem gets fixed, they just know they want it fixed.  If you hear a commercial every half hour that RP will fix education, that's how your going to remember him.  If they don't understand why the Department of Education is a bad idea, you isolate that voter because they can't connect with you.

Most relions that I've seen are very unimaginative. Take the big three Abrahamic religions, for example: they believe in a huge, all-powerful God who created the universe, and placed us at the center of it, and focused His attention exclusively on a few tribes in the Middle East a long time ago. Doesn't that sound like an incredibly *small-minded* religious belief? newlinechar  newlinechar There's so much more to imagine than the stuff you can find in the boxes of religious thought.
'Face' is bullshit. Empires don't act to save face. They act to enrich the ruling class.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think it's still mainly about the oil, but I'm starting to suspect that the neocons *wanted* a mess over there so they could keep funneling lucrative contracts to their bosses.

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology%29): newlinechar &gt; Punishment newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Atlas along with his brother Menoetius sided with the gods in their war (known as the Titanomachy) against the Olympians. His brothers Prometheus and Epimetheus weighed the odds and betrayed the other Titans by an alliance with the Olympians. When the Titans were defeated, many of them (including Menoetius) were confined to Tartarus, but Zeus condemned Atlas to stand at the western edge of the earth and hold up the Sky on his shoulders, to prevent the two from resuming their primordial embrace. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;A common misconception is that Atlas was forced to hold the earth on his shoulders, but this is incorrect. Classical art shows Atlas holding a Celestial Sphere, not a Globe.

If you want to sell PCs, x86 is the architecture of choice, because people like to run Windows, and thats what WIndows runs on. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to sell Palm Pilots, ARM is the architecture of choice for the same reason. newlinechar  newlinechar But its a self-perpetuating trend.  At first, the best smart phones use ARM CPUs, so people who want to make CPUs for smart phones make ARM CPUs.  But then the best smart phone CPUs are ARMs, so people making smartphones choose ARM.  The same thing with x86.  The desktop market wanted fast, cheap CPUs and happened to use x86, so the people who make x86 made fast, cheap CPUs.  Now if you want a fast cheap CPU, the fastest cheapest CPUs tend to be x86. newlinechar  newlinechar Beyond basic stuff like that, I think there's a lot of group-think to it.  Why does telecom hardware tend to be PPC?  Why does radiation hardened hardware tend to be MIPS?  And so on.

When they *also* preach *against* the use of condoms - spreading lies like people will go to hell for using them and at worst that they actually *cause* AIDS... then that's millions of deaths directly on the shoulders of those religious pricks. newlinechar  newlinechar Bush here is saying that those people, the ones spreading FUD about condom use, are instrumental to fighting the pandemic.

I think you mean the 14th Amendment (equal protection). The 10th Amendment (unenumerated powers go to the States) is what Ron Paul uses as justification for saying that abortion rights are a matter left to the States. Ron Paul's argument against *federal* involvement in abortion issues is not religious. It is simply that action on abortion issues is an not enumerated power of the federal government.

Good question. If you're just hashing passwords, SHA-1 should still serve even though it has been somewhat weakened.

I think that the very fact that the man donated his sperm, and did not have sex with her should imply that he was not intending to parent the child to any intelligent person.

Ok, this does require going a little deeper than the rest of this thread. I think that it's clear that abortion was well known in the time of the Founders, and that it was strictly outlawed and yet also common. We could dig up historical details, but I'm fairly sure we're both broadly on the same page here. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm relatively sure they would have outlawed abortion at a Federal level, had they thought that abortion would ever have been legal and widely available. I think a close parallel is questions about whether the Second Amendment includes cruise missiles :) newlinechar  newlinechar I think the question has changed for three reasons: newlinechar  newlinechar * Abortion is now safe and reliable newlinechar * We understand far, far more about embryonic and fetal development newlinechar * The role of women as chattel is gone, and therefore the rights of women must be re-examined newlinechar  newlinechar Now, not to be pat, but here's one approach: If Ben Franklin or Thomas Jefferson or Tom Paine had been female, knowing what we know now, would they have made abortion a recognized right? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure. newlinechar  newlinechar It's possibly the would simply have said 'this is **absolutely** a natural right and needs no more protection than the right to self-defense, which cannot be abrogated.' newlinechar  newlinechar See the basic approach? I think the issue is that abortion is a natural right, in a control-of-one's-own-person sense, and this is an area where I think we're dealing one level further down the layers of thought from which our recognition of rights emerges. newlinechar  newlinechar What do you think?
&gt; The MS guy is only bragging that the IE bugs were fixed in-house before release.

This is just bad security analysis, though.

'The environment is better protected under private property rights .... We as property owners can't violate our neighbors' property. We can't pollute their air or their water.

There's quite a difference between 'nazi past' and 'being mobilised to Waffen-SS'. You seem to imply an ideological reason for the presence of estonians in Waffen-SS, while the basic line of thought was mostly 'whoever will give me a gun to shoot at soviets'. If you dig a bit deeper into the history you'll find that estonian numbers in Waffen-SS soared only _after_ the tide of wider WW2 had turned and Soviet forces moved towards Estonian lands again. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Forgot about your last paragraph. They were 'volunteers' only in the sense that the government in exile withdrew it's orders to resist the mobilisation. newlinechar  newlinechar Moreover, learn the difference between Waffen-SS and SS proper. Waffen-SS was set up specifically for frontline units of non-germans, _without_ the ideological indoctrination.

Are you serious?  If you had done a wiki search for trinity, the first sentence is: newlinechar  newlinechar '*Central[1][2] to Christianity,* Trinity is the doctrine that God is one being who exists, simultaneously and eternally, as a mutual indwelling of three persons (not to be confused by 'person'): the Father, *the Son (incarnate as Jesus of Nazareth)*, and the Holy Spirit.' (emphasis mine). newlinechar  newlinechar Google it, and after Wikipedia and a couple things about trinity university, there's the Catholic Encyclopedia, whose first sentence states: newlinechar  newlinechar 'The Trinity is the term employed to signify *the central doctrine of the Christian religion* -- the truth that in the unity of the Godhead there are Three Persons, the Father, *the Son,* and the Holy Spirit, these Three Persons being truly distinct one from another.' (emphasis mine again) Follow the hyperlink for Son and they clarify that it is Jesus, and expresses his divinity. newlinechar  newlinechar Or, if thirty seconds of internet research is too much, you might recall having read in John 1:1 'In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.' newlinechar  newlinechar In short: It is a central idea of nearly all forms of Christianity (the only exception I know of is the Jehovah's Witnesses and maybe LDS) that Jesus is in fact God.

As I said, I agree the example you quoted is wrong no matter how it's sliced. My guess is the writer had faint memories of the distinction from grammar school but either misremembered or misapplied it. Also, my use of the term 'monolithic whole' was unfortunate; what I meant to convey is that the singular is used to refer to a group or a society or a company as a thing in itself. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's an example that shows the distinction put to correct use: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The Praetorian Guard [the institution] _was_ founded by Augustus. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The Praetorian Guard [the members thereof] _were_ escorting the emperor to the Forum. newlinechar  newlinechar You could, as you suggest, rewrite sentences of the second sort to be more explicit: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The _members of_ the Praetorian guard were escorting the emperor to the Forum. newlinechar  newlinechar And it might be a good idea to do so. It does draw possibly unwanted attention to the 'members' part, and it's less terse and arguably less elegant. But the choice of one or the other comes down to style, not grammar; you'll find the grammatical distinction described in classics such as Strunk &amp; White and Fowler, so I certainly didn't invent it.

&gt;Firstly, the Bush government promotes an ABC (A for abstinence, B for being faithful and C for condoms). This is not an irrational approach.

Yes and no.  Although mortgage interest is tax deductible in the US, it only matters if the interest you pay is greater than the standard deduction, assuming you have no other deductions to itemize.  With the single standard deduction at $5350 that means that unless your loan balance is over $85,000 or so (assuming typical interest rates), you're not saving anything by deducting mortgage interest.  Of course, you'll probably have other things (such as state or local taxes) to deduct if you itemize, so there still can be a benefit to deducting mortgage interest even with a small loan. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, investing the money is less productive than it first appears, because you have to pay tax on the profit from the investment.  Add in the effects of inflation (which you are effectively taxed on as well!), and your real gains are even lower.
You must agree that there are strong arguments for both pro-choice and pro-life stands, and people are never going to unanimously agree on one or the other.

The 14th amendment is the worst thing about the current constitution. It was originally intended to give black people equal rights, but the Supreme court used it to pass federal regulations down to the states. This zapped a great majority of the sovereignty of the individual states. newlinechar  newlinechar So I disagree that the 14th amendment was a step forward. What it was was step in nationalizing everything. The federal laws were never meant to apply to the states and now we are subject to a myriad of federal departments imposing themselves upon the states. newlinechar  newlinechar This is why Ron Paul wants to eliminate the federal departments, to give strength back to the states. newlinechar  newlinechar Have you every seen [Ron Paul's hr300](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-300&amp;tab=summary). This is a bill to restrict the Supreme Court from hearing some first amendment cases. Specially separation of church and state. If you ever wonder why Paul would be against the first amendment, its because it was never originally intended to be applied to the states. The states have their own constitutions and they can simply be amended to contain these rights, but the federal government didn't want that, they wanted to eliminate state authority in the matter altogether. newlinechar  newlinechar Passing HR300 would be a small step to repealing the effect of the 14th amendment.

Compare the number of people who show up at rallys and straw polls - its not just the internet.  Lets not kid ourselves.   If anything, a better argument is that Ron Paul support is only around 10% but that 10% is rabid and show up everywhere giving a false impression of support. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As far as polling, the polls use a database of voters from previous Republican/Democratic primary elections.   It is impossible for his support to translate into the polls - by virtue of how the polls are conducted.   The pollers use federal (and state level) voter databases to generate a list of 'likely voters' (required to be maintained by federal/state law).   This list is based on who voted in that specific party's primary for the last 1 (or last 2 or 3) primaries.   From this list (essentially a majority of Bush/Kerry supporters) they get their numbers.   They never voter registrations and almost never (unless they are targeting this demographic) use recent registered voters.   They get better results from these database lists.   Up until this year, that would be true...voter apathy is pretty consistent and voter turnout for primaries are typical 10-15% for Republicans.   This leaves 85%-90% or the registered voters, who, for whatever reason, did not vote in a previous primary.  It also does not include, by design, 21yr old and younger or republican converts. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Correct, its not a media conspiracy in the literal sense.   But the media is not going to change its polling methods just to determine if Ron Pauls support (easily the front runner in every other indicator except these polls - straw poll/debate poll/rally size/fundraising/grassroots support) extends beyong the Republican base.   I agree, he needs to get more support from his base Republicans.   I just dont see former Bush supporters picking him. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I dont claim he is winning - I think he needs 8% nationwide, or at least a couple wins and strong showings in the other early states. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Its going to be interesting to see how it shapes up in the end.   I think anyone who thinks he has 20-25% overall because of 'cross-overs' or because cell phones are not used are deluding themselves.   In the end it will depend on voter turnout.   8% can beat 25% with a high voter turnout. newlinechar  newlinechar

Hardly.  If you want to explain the origins of something to me in an intellectually honest manner, you either have to explain it using less complicated tools (evolution) or explain why the more complicated tools exist (ID, or the 'who created the Creator').  Logic builds upon 'first principles' - never do we prove our assumptions using our conclusions - and if you want to go outside logic, you're failing to provide an intellectual argument. newlinechar  newlinechar An example: the famous 'first mover' posits that the creator has always existed and will always exist.  Using the logic that 'something' can always exist, then there is no need for the first mover - it's turtles all the way down.  In other words, it's self-contradictory to claim that an uncreated creator explains the beginning of time.

&gt; Now do you see why claiming that god exists without producing a single observation makes you seem like someone who's fallen in love with an imaginary friend? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Let's go back to my original analogy, because you misinterpreted it. Here's an excerpt: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  Not only can you not prove these deeply personal feelings, but the very question of proof is irrelevent in this kind of relationship. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Love is a feeling. Who or what you love is irrelevent to the feeling. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My point was that individual feelings and experiences cannot be proven or disproven. Feelings are at the core of a human being, and there is no way by which you or science can prove or disprove the way someone feels. In fact, this is why we don't require people to prove feelings, because we can't! Sometimes people fake how they feel, or pretend to be depressed, or sad, but we always except them to be true in our society (and in science) unless we have reason to believe the person is lying. Thus, in logical terms, feelings are sufficient for the individual.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Belief in God is also sufficient for the individual. Faith is not a communal act. By its very nature, it is individual, just like feelings. And when someone has faith, they have it. If you don't have it, then you don't have it, and just because you don't feel that way does not mean someone else can't feel that way. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Another example: A sociopath cannot feel empathy. Yet you can (I'm assuming you aren't a sociopath). No matter how hard you try, you will never, ever be able to convince a sociopath that empathy exists. It simply is non-existent from a sociopath's perspective. It cannot exist, and if it did, it would not make sense. To a sociopath, human beings have no value except the value they can provide to the sociopathic individual. They do not care about human beings, and the fact that you do proves to them nothing. To them it just shows that your way of looking at the world is crazy, while their way is normal. When in fact, we know that sociopaths aren't normal, and their non-empathetic way of looking at the world is in fact the true mental illness (of course, they don't understand this). They see empathy as a falsity - like faith - and a crutch for the weak, when in fact it is a natural emotion in most people. Faith in God is analogous to feelings, because it is spiritual, and spiritual concepts are not applicable to anything but individuals (within the physical world).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Does that make sense?  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The recepient of love was not the point at all, which is why your conter-example is misleading. It does not address my argument. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My goal is not for you to believe in God. My goal is for you to accept the fact that some people are justified in believing in God, just as some people are justified in not believing in God.
All functional programming languages (that I know of) have short-circuiting OR.  I believe the author's problem is that all functions must return a value in a purely-functional language, and so if you've got a recursive call, you've got to check the return value and propagate your True upwards.  Sufficiently smart compilers could probably optimize this away, so I don't think he's really concerned about efficiency, but he dislikes the boilerplate coding. newlinechar  newlinechar Haskell uses monads to hide the boilerplate - if you have a Left (exceptional) value, the &gt;&gt;= (bind) operator propagates that as the complete result of the computation, rather than evaluating any of the other function calls.  'Course, then you have to write your code in monadic style, which often looks a little different from a straight recursive algorithm anyway.
The problem here is not defining 'rights,' but rather, 'child support.'  The law needs to define a certain standard of living that encompasses all aspects of modern life (not simply income) and ensure that all people (not just citizens) are able to achieve it.  'Child support' needs to provide children, not with money, but with adequate shelter, food/drink, health care, etc.  If 'child support,' defined as a certain amount of money, is truly the right of the child, then the checks should be made out to them.  Because of children's lack of judgmental capabilities, this course of actions is not in the child's best interest.  Also, If a father saw that his aid was directly helping the child, and he was not simply writing a check to the mother every month, I would bet that there would be much less animosity between the parents, and possibly less therapy in the child's future.  Changing pace a bit, I think the reason that we hold children in high esteem is actually biologically encoded into us as humans.  Humans reproduce very slowly and therefor much more of an investment is required in every child. (As opposed to spiders, who have a 'fire and forget' strategy for reproduction). newlinechar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_needs) newlinechar  newlinechar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction#Reproductive_strategies) newlinechar

I'm not sure I'd consider languages like Joy to be in a separate group from FP. You could argue that Joy is a function level language where the only operation on functions is composition. More precisely, composition is the only available 'functional form'. By this definition, compositional languages are a subset of function level languages.

You're either confused, or you're just abusing language here. newlinechar  newlinechar To be charitable, I'll assume the second.  What you really mean is that you think it is 'wrong' (in whatever sense) to advocate the killing of someone who has done no harm to you. newlinechar  newlinechar But being wrong is not identical with being ignorant; nor is your thinking someone wrong necessarily a reason to think that they are ignorant - i.e. that they lack some relevant information.
That's interesting.

I don't think you'd find many atheists who claim that they wouldn't change their views if they found strong evidence of god. newlinechar  newlinechar You may have a semantic point, but the only practical change you are advocating is that virtually no one should classify themselves as atheist. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you really think everyone should be agnostic towards everything? I noted(and you seem to have taken no objection) that I disbelieve in god to the same degree that I hold my most strongly held beliefs. I compared it to my certainty that when I drop a ball it will fall. Therefore, if I should classify myself as agnostic towards God, then shouldn't I classify  myself as agnostic towards everything?

I think you speak of the essence of greed and humanity. 'Capitalism' is using money or some other form of capital to move around 'wealth'. It is neither good or evil. A greedy person will horde and cheat against others no matter what people use to move around wealth and resources. This is what caused the failure of 'Communism' in it's respective attempts. It's not about the system, it's about the people. Take a good system and put it in the hands of bad people and the results will be bad. Put a bad system in the hands of good people and you maybe surprised to find that it will end up good.
And you're wrong too.  Your return is the interest you're not paying on that debt.  Mortgages are at what, 6-7% now?  That's your guaranteed return from paying off your mortgage.  It certainly beats T-bills, and is close to the long-term average return on the stock market. newlinechar  newlinechar If it were any debt *other* than a mortgage (including, I believe HELOCs), you can tack an additional 30-40% onto that, because pennies saved are *after tax*.  But mortgage interest is tax deductible, so taxes don't enter into calculations.

That's right. Capitalism has been more successful than any other system in feeding people.

I think he's right.  There is no legitimate reason that the 'overlords' should be able to restrict what consenting adults do by themselves in private.  The fact that there are some bad apples, who do crazy things, does not mean the rights of everyone else should be infringed.  I have no reason not to think that the right to consume substances, harming no one, in private, is a fundamental natural right and should be protected by the 9th amendment. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. newlinechar  newlinechar -- Benjamin Franklin newlinechar  newlinechar Why should individuals not have the right to consume drugs?  The fact that some people go berserk is, again, not an argument against it, any more than deaths from automobile accidents (many, many more than drug deaths) is an argument against vehicle transportation.  If you look at the [statistics](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/causes.htm), you see that more deaths are caused by alcohol and tobacco than auto accidents, which are more numerous than other drugs.  For that matter, why not outlaw fatty foods, because 60% of America is fast?  Shut McDonald's down; make it illegal.  Make guns illegal.  And credit cards. newlinechar  newlinechar The right to consume any substance a citizen wishes is an important one that must be preserved.  Anything else is arbitrary and/or unfair.

Here's superior IQ in action: newlinechar  newlinechar You attempt at a deductive argument (anyway, I *think* you were going for this...) is invalid. newlinechar  newlinechar You started with 'pertinent to world affairs' and moved to the equivalent of '*part* of world affairs'.  Oops - that's a no go. newlinechar  newlinechar Chavez's mental health would not generally be considered a *matter* of world affairs (even if it may have an *impact* on world affairs).  No one would describe a book written just about Chavez's mental state as a book 'about world affairs' - nor would anyone suggest that someone 'read some books about world affairs' if their intent was to suggest that someone learn about Chavez's mental state. newlinechar  newlinechar It is clear that the response to Mudslag was not a suggestion to learn more about Hugo Chavez so Mudslag would know that Chavez is not insane.  Since the suggestion was given as a potential remedy to Mudslag's alleged ignorance, the content of that alleged ignorance would have to match the content of the suggested remedy.  Since the content of the suggested remedy was not learning about Chavez's mental state, then the ignorance alleged was not an ignorance of Chavez's mental state. newlinechar  newlinechar We are left, then, we the obvious reading of the response:  Mudslag is ignorant of world affairs (when we take 'world affairs' to mean what we would mean when we use the term in everyday conversation).   newlinechar  newlinechar Clearly, then, the criticism is unfounded, as Mudslag wrote nothing that would indicate his or her level of familiarity with world affairs.   newlinechar  newlinechar Since the cause for the allegation of ignorance was not any *demonstration* of ignorance, the cause must lie elsewhere.  There is no other reasonable possibility, given the brevity of Mudslag's comment, other than the preference Mudslag expressed for Chavez's being killed. newlinechar  newlinechar There is of course no reason to assume, from Mudslag's preference that Chavez be killed, that Mudslag is ignorant of anything.  (If you were more clever, you might have made an argument that Mudslag is ignorant of some '*moral*' facts - but doubtlessly this would be too complex an issue for you.)  So, back to my original point:  The inference from Mudslag's preference to Mudslag's ignorance, being entirely unfounded, demonstrates poor reasoning. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

It also provides a very stable ABI.  This is because the mapping to the hardware is usually fairly straight-forward: there's only a few obvious ways to do things.  A struct contains only the elements listed in it, no thunks for lazy updating, no vtables for dynamic dispatch, or RTTI.  This means once an ABI has been defined, it is useful for interlanguage bridges, OS interfaces, etc. Things don't arbitrarily break when the compiler writers find out they can shave a bit of performance out by altering the calling convention.

My wife is a kindergarten teacher in a very poor district.  I can tell you from experience that poor kids are stupid.  (ok, generalities do not always apply) Often low income families don't have time to spend with their kids teaching them what they need to know.  Many don't know that they should be reading to their children, and start teaching them to read before they go to kindergarten.  Those kids come to school knowing nothing, and often have trouble adjusting.  Some only know what they learned from TV.  A minority of those parents recognize the need for their children to get off to a good start, and work tirelessly with them.  These children excel and it has nothing to do with their income, or the funding of the school. newlinechar  newlinechar A lack of money is not what makes the kids stupid, but a lack of parental attention and instruction.  The same thing applies to well funded, and poorly funded schools.  You will get out of your education what you put into it.

That's the fallacy I was highlighting.  The article is as specific as it gets: whether one commodity in one sector is a free market or subsidized, and what happens to food production as a result.   newlinechar  newlinechar The free market certainly did fail in this case, even according to the American/British studies.  A LOT of lives can be saved by looking at the practical results.

Botswana, like most countries in the region, has also has been receiving food aid due to the African famines starting in 2002.  Their hunger rates were on a par with Malawi (*before* Malawi's huge success with subsidies), even though Botswana has 15 times more arable land per person.  Egypt gets $1.8 billion from the US, not $3 billion.  $1.3B of it is military credits; and none of it is food - Egypt gives food aid to other countries.  Libya is right next door, has just as much oil as Egypt, and does just as well in hunger rates without similar aid.

Some would say that being a lawyer only requires loose morality, and the argument I've read that favors the idea of Jewish intellectual superiority bases it on success at criminal activity. newlinechar  newlinechar It's probably best not to go down the 'master race' road, er, 'chosen people' (damn I always get those two confused).

I'm talking primarily about the new and browse pages. newlinechar  newlinechar Downvotes count towards the recommended page regardless of where they take place. newlinechar  newlinechar You are *supposed* to downvote the stuff you aren't interested in.

How can different developers access the same image instance?

The local Conservative Party, which was heavily in bed with Bush in the lead up to the last Canadian elections, actually enacted as their first major piece of legislation, laws making it illegal for corporate bodies (unions and businesses alike) to fund political parties.  This is the MOST right wing party in Canada cutting the financial ties to big money in Canada! newlinechar  newlinechar Look at the GOP AND Democrat resistance to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill from a few years ago and compare ... very, very different worlds.

&gt; They're representing popularity among real organizations newlinechar  newlinechar No they're not. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; which, as you mentioned earlier yourself, is a far more meaningful measure than a random sample of IP addresses. newlinechar  newlinechar That makes no sense. Representation isn't a function of the data, but whether the data has been tested. They could take their data by asking admins at a conference, but unless they can demonstrate why those admins at the conference represent admins who are *not* at the conference, then the data isn't tested. newlinechar  newlinechar The benefit to a *random* selection is that you don't have any selection problems like this. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I defy you to find any organization with a sysadmin experienced enough to install and patch qmail, yet whose DNS domain lacks an MX RR. newlinechar  newlinechar You'll just weasel out of it like you always do. Then claim I said some things that I didn't say simply because you don't know what you're talking about, but here you go `dmvnoc.com` is also AS21863 (and operate 216.169.144.0/20) and doesn't have an MX record. They also run qmail. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; these particular surveys explicitly do not sample the mail servers of parked domains, newlinechar  newlinechar I like how you edited my response. You're a weasel. You said: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And there's no MX record pointing to a mail server unless the domain's owner adds it. And, to spell this out for you, that's only going to happen if somebody is setting up a real, honest-to-goodness mail service. newlinechar  newlinechar And I pointed out you were wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I would also point out that this is contradictory to your argument just two paragraphs ago newlinechar  newlinechar Go ahead and point it out. Quote verbatim. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; DJB's original study is outdated and unverified. newlinechar  newlinechar Lots of people verified it. His method does indeed yield the results that it claims to. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; There is no data to support any claim of qmail being the #2 most popular mail server today newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know that. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Therefore, calling qmail 'the #2 MTA on the Internet' is factually incorrect. newlinechar  newlinechar It might be incorrect. It might not. The fact here is that you don't know. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Studies of businesses and large organizations have shown qmail to be ranked much lower than #2 in the list of the most popular MTAs among real installations newlinechar  newlinechar I don't believe you. I have seen two of your reports and I said they're wrong. I said *why* they're wrong. You haven't demonstrated how they are right, so I reject this. newlinechar  newlinechar As near as I can tell you don't know what representative means. I've tried explaining it multiple times but you ignore it and keep acting like it means something else. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Now, do you or do you not have the data or rational arguments to refute either of these plainly stated and helpfully emphasized points? newlinechar  newlinechar Yes: You don't understand statistics well enough to interpret the data that you think you have. newlinechar  newlinechar I said it's not representative and you thought I meant they were trying to be misleading. *Any* statistician would have known that I was calling them stupid, not dishonest. newlinechar  newlinechar I said that popularity is hard to measure and you said it's easy to measure because MX records *mean something*. I said no they don't, you don't know what you're talking about. When I point out both legitimate sites  lack MX records and illegitimate sites have them you argue that these studies *ignore sites without MX records*. newlinechar  newlinechar Ignoring data makes them wrong. It means that whatever they're ignoring is a selection criteria. Maybe Postfix is the second most popular mail server if you only look at small sites run by people with A+ certification. If that's what these surveys actually demonstrate then they're not interesting at all. They certainly do not measure popularity (number of sites, or number of addresses) on the internet, deployment density (how many installs of postfix per organization), or load (messages per second per install). *Those* would all be *interesting* things. newlinechar  newlinechar If you wanted to measure number of sites or number of addresses the only way to do it would be to do it *randomly*. newlinechar  newlinechar You said I have ignored your arguments and simply said that nobody should have to refute them because you are stupid and mean and weasel-like. I said no such thing and have done my best to reply to *each and every one of your points*.

It's just regional differences, which really are minor.  Was the chicken fundamentally different from KFC in the US?  Probably not.  A Big Mac is a Big Mac, regardless of where you buy it, even though you'll get borscht in a McDonalds in Moscow and poutine in a McDonalds in Canada. newlinechar  newlinechar Ketchup, for example, is very different between Canada and the US.  When I travel south, I can't stand the watery swill that is passed off as ketchup down there and I know for a fact Heinz uses different formulas for the two countries because they know tastes differ.

Thank you very much. ;-) I have one more question: newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously, one could use more than one hash function, and require that all of them match. However, without a deeper understanding of the actual hashes used (and their associated problems), it is difficult to judge whether that doesn't just convey a false sense of security.  newlinechar  newlinechar Would you suggest that using e.g. SHA-256 and one of the 'unproven' hashes that you mention is a good approach to obtaining a reasonable level of security?
I believe I wrote: newlinechar  newlinechar 'the government should be working on things governments should be doing (ie running the country)' newlinechar  newlinechar I agree - the war on drugs is absurd; there is no government justification for it.
We are. Those of us who care, anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately, many Americans don't think it matters that Muslims are dying and are being tortured. They don't believe in Human Rights. They don't think that Muslims deserve the same basic set of human rights as Christians. They think that most of them are probably evil. They blame anything bad that happens to the few good ones on the evil Muslims that made us start a war with them and institute harsh interrogation policies. It is not unlike the Nazis blaming the Jews for World War II. newlinechar  newlinechar They also think that God will make it right for the good ones who were killed and/or tortured in the end. newlinechar  newlinechar It's frightening, to say the least.
Yeh actually in Mootools and Prototype there are great class building tools, simplified syntax etc.  jQuery is more of a utility or base and can be used with these kits without conflict. jQuery and Moo are a bit different but Moo and proto are in the same class.  Using mootools and prototype is overkill as they accomplish the same purpose.  Personally I like Mootools better than Prototype. But if we are talking best javascript kit it is hands down jQuery in my opinion.

It could have been something other than the meat. And yes, proscuitto is divine. I'll reconsider, and since I live with a vegetarian I don't eat too many meals that are meat heavy anyways. I would also encourage you to look into locally grown veggies (good variety of veggies usually, and in general better for you, cept in the winter if your in one of those cold kinds of places). Also, keep in mind that buying meat from ethically run small farms is a wonderful way to support opposition to factor farming and maintain *some* moral high ground, you know should you ever get the prosciutto bug again.

However, the fact is that South Africa is not open to non-white immigration. It is impossible to do so without losing the white national character of South Africa which is by definition a white state. The only way you could allow 'blacks' on occupied territories to become citizens is annexation, which isn't something anyone would want; and even if that happened, who guarantees that once the borders are removed and the communications are open again, they wouldn't go back to bombings when they don't like, for example, taxes or national holidays? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I doubt that anyone who emigrates to the territories and not Israel can get citizenship, not sure though. newlinechar  newlinechar If you are Jewish you get citizenship.

First, a singly-linked list in any imperative language has the same type as a scheme cons list; conses aren't 'needlessly nested'. Second, a nested list is a representation of an n-ary tree, and in any imperative language a search of an n-ary tree will look exactly the same as the purely-functional version: you either have to use recursion on the real stack or iteration with an auxiliary stack.

I don't know if you are ignorant or simply a person who thinks they know the truth of who everyone is and how they should act.  I'm not going to try to give a defense of trans-people here myeslf, there are far more eloquent people out there.

For example, imagine a blog site where URLs look like `http://www.alltheblogs.com/Suzie/last_weeks_post`.

I would be very happy if Dubai was as great as it's promoted...I think that it would be wonderful to have a Middle Easter city that was completely accessible to Westerners, without the downsides that often happen, and as a Canadian I can't imagine why anyone would be jealous of another country's success.  That's kind of ludicrous.   newlinechar  newlinechar I know a few people there who are making piles of money as well...an architect from B.C. who's cleaning up, a couple of construction bosses, and a tourism co-ordinator.  They're making more money than they can count, but the fact is that most of the money is going to the ruling family or certainly the ruling class...there are too many articles to post, but just google it. There is no doubt at all that there is money to be made there, but I don't think that anyone can make an argument that the actual people of Dubai (not the imported workers, sex slaves, or basic families that lived there) are coming off well at the moment.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are some good links [here](http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2007/09/dubai_sex_for_slinks.html)  ...sorry, I haven't had much luck posting links lately, but Dubai's at the head of the watch list for a number of organizations that try to stop sex trafficking.   newlinechar  newlinechar There's definitely money there, no question.

A negative right to life allows an individual to defend his life from others trying to kill him or to obtain voluntary assistance from others in order to defend his life, but he may not force others to defend him because he has no natural right to be provided with defense. To force a person to defend one's own negative rights, or the negative rights of a third party, would be to violate that person's negative rights.

It has been my experience that where the weeding out of the workers from the chaff used to happen at the HS level, that filtering process has now moved up the ranks into Bachelor degrees.

Seriously.  The only reason the new company will be called Activision Blizzard is because not too many non-gamers even know who Vivendi is. newlinechar  newlinechar If people even bothered to read the article, Vivendi will be the majority share holder in this merger.  Nothing much, if anything, will change by this. newlinechar  newlinechar *edit: Merger Press Release from Blizzard* ([http://www.blizzard.com/press/activision-faq.shtml](http://www.blizzard.com/press/activision-faq.shtml)) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Q: What are the details of the deal? newlinechar A: Under the terms of an agreement with Vivendi, Blizzard and the other companies that make up Vivendi Games will combine with Activision to form a new public company called Activision Blizzard. We do not anticipate any difference in Blizzard's operations as a result of the combination. Joining forces with Activision will create a stronger and more diversified company that we anticipate will benefit and strengthen both brands. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: What will happen to the Blizzard brand name? newlinechar A: The Blizzard brand name will stay the same as it's always been: Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: What will change with regard to the day-to-day operations at Blizzard? newlinechar A: There will be no changes in the way Blizzard operates. All of the people, processes, and philosophies that have made Blizzard so successful will be preserved. Blizzard will benefit from all-star sales and distribution teams to service our products. In addition, the combined company will be stronger financially, managerially, and operationally. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: How will this impact Blizzard's games? newlinechar A: This will not impact Blizzard's games. We remain committed to providing the same high-quality game content and support that we always have. Development on Wrath of the Lich King and StarCraft II, as well as on our unannounced games, is continuing as normal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will there be any visible differences in Blizzard's logo or packaging/marketing materials as a result of this deal? newlinechar A: No, there won't be any changes to our company name, logo, packaging/marketing materials, or anything else along those lines. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will there be any management changes at Blizzard as a result of this deal? newlinechar A: No, there won't be any management changes at Blizzard as a result of the combination. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will Activision and Blizzard now share development teams? newlinechar A: No, both of our companies will continue to operate as they have previously with regard to game development. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will the release schedules for any Blizzard games be impacted? newlinechar A: No, the transaction will not have any impact on our games, our day-to-day operations, or our release timelines. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will any of Blizzard's offices close as a result of the deal? Or, will any new offices open? newlinechar A: No, all of our offices will continue to function as they have, and we don't foresee the need to open any new offices for the time being. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Will any employees move to different offices as a result of the deal? newlinechar A: We don't anticipate making any such moves as a result of the deal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: Does this deal include Activision's and Blizzard's international offices? newlinechar A: Yes, every part of our companies in the U.S. and abroad is involved in this deal. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: If Activision Blizzard is a public company, does that mean I'll now be able to buy stock in Blizzard? newlinechar A: Activision will be renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc and will continue to be a publicly listed company traded on NASDAQ. You will be able to buy stock in the combined company. newlinechar  newlinechar Q: When will the transaction be complete? newlinechar A: The transaction is subject to approval of Activision shareholders, customary closing conditions, and regulatory approvals. Pending approval, the companies expect the transaction to be completed by mid 2008.

Each region/country in the world has different groups of gamers so I can't speak for them all, but I'm not a kid anymore; since about 1994 I have been playing PC games.  In about 1997/98 I got my own computer.  I never played a Blizzard game other than casually, I played Starcraft on a 486 for God's sake.  What inspired me to spend thousands of dollars on computer hardware (and my 5 or so close friends) was FPS games.  Quake II required OpenGL, which required AGP card, which required a new motherboard.  Every upgrade since then has been over an FPS game, Quake III, Doom 3, Quake 4, Half-Life 2, etc.  I am part of a huge community that plays Counter-Strike 1.6 and Source, and I know that there are huge communities for the Battlefield games and a few other online FPS as well.  So, WoW is a demanding game and all that, but its not the only game ever to encourage an upgrade.

It depends on your engine. In some engines you have to have the fields listed in your SQL in order before it will use the combined index.

&gt;The fineness of a game is relative newlinechar  newlinechar No it isn't.  Sure, certain aspects of any game (like how much fun you can have, or how long you can play at a stretch) are subjective and relative to the player who is playing.  But there are many aspects of Games that can be compaired in absolute terms with all other Games and judged according to how well they are done. newlinechar  newlinechar Things like the Complexity of the Rule Set, Complexity Potential in Player Strategies, Availability of Player State, degree of definition to Progress and Score, degrees to which the Player may influence the Game State, and many others. newlinechar  newlinechar Especailly in Video Games, there are a number of technical accomplishments that can be judged objectivly such as the Security of the Game State, the level of detail that can be rendered at a playable framerate, network latency as it affects playablity. newlinechar  newlinechar In all of these areas, WoW shows a high degree of fine craftmanship, any Game Designer would be proud to have made something even half as good. Controls are responcive and consistant, your avatar's abilites and state are readily available, interactions with other characters and world objects are consistant, progress is easily measured on any of the metrics you might choose. newlinechar  newlinechar WoW is a very easy game to love or hate because it is very well defined and very well made.  You know what you are playing.  It's easy to get into and play and offers some very deep challenges.  It is, in any objective sense, a great game.  Whether you like it or not. newlinechar  newlinechar Its only real failing in my opinion is its rather weak/non-existant storyline.  But given the choice between a compelling Story and a compelling Game; it is trying to sell itself as a Game and I think they made the right call.

'The snap must be a quick and continuous movement of the ball by one or both hands of the snapper, and the ball must leave the snapper's hands.

I used to be sorta dragged into these very conservative Christian Youth conferences and I still remember several years ago (I couldn't have been more than 12 or so) when the church service started off with a similar video on this gigantic screen when thundering speakers, except this video was 10x as graphic with worms crawling out of burning bodies and screaming and blood everywhere. newlinechar  newlinechar As an atheist, it was appalling to see not only all these literally hundreds and hundreds of preteens to young teenagers scared shitless and crying, but all the little toddlers who were screaming. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, the first two videos weren't really all that bad.

Yeah, but try lugging around 500 pounds of copper, or 16 barrels of oil or 12 bushels of grain.  Try cutting your car or diamond in half, and selling off each half at half the price of the original.

That's what makes them such good money and such a good inflation hedge, especially in times of chaos or disaster.

&gt;I haven't read the bill. But you know I've read a lot of what people have been writing about the bill. Is that good enough? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I have the bill and I can tell you absolutely, it does NOT infringe upon anyone's civil rights. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar All the bill does - and I mean ALL - is to create a *committee*.  That committee is tasked with studying the causes of domestic terrorism, calling people to testify as needed, and sending reports to Congress with recommendations on how to prevent any more domestic terrorism. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And that, believe it or not, is IT.  That is all it does.  That is what has wadded so many panties - including, apparently, Kucinich's.  So it cannot, as you have been incorrectly told, 'give police and the intelligence service powers that they don't have right now.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, the definitions everyone is so unhappy about aren't even that bad.  A careful reading (as opposed to an OMG BIG BROTHER! reading) reveals that the emphasis on them is on the intent on doing violence.  The bill does not claim ideologies are themselves terroristic - it wants to look at people who join an ideology for the purpose of doing violence.  See the difference?   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Plus the definitions ONLY apply within the bill and the committee to be created anyway, so even if the definitions were what people claim, they *still* would not be any threat to anyone's liberty. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And in the meantime, the end result is a whole lot of people are now trying to oppose the government doing something which (I thought) those very same people had been claiming it needed to do - STUDY terrorism and its causes, so rational policy can be made. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And I'm sad that Kucinich has apparently given in to the tinfoil hatters and is opposing it now.

You are absolutely right that for a few high level classes, it makes sense. These are few and far between however.

From http://www.humanfactors.com/downloads/nov02.asp : newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; What can we conclude when users are reading prose text from monitors? Users tend to read faster if the line lengths are longer (up to 10 inches). If the line lengths are too short (2.5 inches or less) it may impede rapid reading. Finally, users tend to prefer lines that are moderately long (4 to 5 inches). newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps it is faster to go from one line to the next with shorter columns, but at the same time long lines mean you just keep reading in a straight line more often? newlinechar  newlinechar You may prefer the conclusions of http://blog.fawny.org/2005/09/21/measures/ instead: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Dyson's research is not a justification for marathon line lengths. It merely indicates that the issue is more complex than in print typography, and, I infer, that categorical declarations are hard to back up with evidence. newlinechar  newlinechar (For my money, the text on that page--and many pages, it seems--is too small.

&gt;Corporation money has destroyed our government newlinechar  newlinechar Progressives like to blame the greed of corporations. Libertarians like to blame the coercion of government. Progressives want democratic action to solve corporations, and end up giving a ton of power to the government. Libertarians want the market to solve problems, and give a ton of power to corporations. newlinechar  newlinechar We need to get together and realize that elite power sucks regardless of where it originates. Progressives need to stop looking at the government as a benevolent solver of problems. Substitute *libertarians* for *progressives* and *the market* for *the government*. newlinechar  newlinechar What we need is a third way. I don't even mean a third party, but a political consensus that acknowledges we need to be ever vigilant against elite power. I think this consensus can be forged and maintained on the internet. I hope that the campaign of Ron Paul is only the start. It shows we can use the internet to raise funds, get together, and act without the help of elite power. We can't trust the media, we can't trust the government, we can't trust large corporations.  newlinechar  newlinechar Here's to making the internet a constituency, and not just a tool, in both senses of the word.

&gt;from what I understand there are sects of JW who do support blood transfusions so even amongst them its a controversial subject. newlinechar  newlinechar I was raised a JW and I can assure you that blood transfusions are a 'no-no' for *all* of them. I don't have the time to look up the scripture(s) they use for this rule, but I'll try to find it later. If memory serves me correctly, it's somewhere in the book of Acts.  newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, I've personally known a couple of people who have almost died due to refusal of blood transfusions based on their beliefs.  newlinechar  newlinechar Even though I haven't been a JW for many years that teaching was so ingrained in me that a few years back, after a surgery I had, the doctor told me I needed one and I hesitated for a minute. Of course, I knew it was for my benefit, so I consented, but I made sure that my parents weren't going to be around because I didn't think I could handle the flack I would get from them if they knew that I had one.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's one of those things that seems to be a no-brainer unless you've been a JW....and especially if you spent most of your life as one.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: WITNESS POSITION ON THERAPY From the [official JW site](http://www.watchtower.org/e/hb/article_06.htm)): ...write them to abstain from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled **and from blood**.

You are close to a teachable moment here, so here comes a lesson. I traveled all over America, living in various locations, when I wore a younger man's clothes. I noticed what you noticed about dallas, for for every large city where I lived. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar What it is is the mass media for each city trying to promote that city as a destination for new residents, and to keep present residents. This is part of what america is all about. The media acts as a mouthpiece for powerful local business interests, such as car dealers, homebuilders, retailers, property owners, etc etcetc. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar These business interests make more money when more people move to their cities, or remain living there. Also when young people move to a city, it lowers wages. Law of supply and demand. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So they want to promote those cities and give them a good reputation. that is part of what sports teams are all about. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The more people move there, the more $$ these business interests make. So they want the media (which they support via ads) to talk about that city as the COOLEST THING AROUND, MAN! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The same thing goes for america on a larger scale. Powerful american business interests want to attract more immigrants because that means they make more money and spend less in wages. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar What I am talking about here is a HUGE part of what the american media and image and politics is all about. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

It's much easier to stay in power once you have it and if you knew you could stay in power for life you would make certain that happens. newlinechar  newlinechar But by that premise Canada would be under a dictatorship forever no?  We have no term limits on our Prime Minister. newlinechar  newlinechar Really, term limits force short term goals instead of long term ones.  What's a President doing in the last four years?  They answer to no one - no recall or anything.  They have unobstructed power without fear of being voted out.

From this story, I'd say it's even worse than that. It's more like: newlinechar  newlinechar Anyone with control of broadcast spectrum is welcome to sell their share of the public's attention, or not, as they feel like. newlinechar  newlinechar I suppose the fact that the FCC (a government agency) controls spectrum would raise a bit of a red flag there too.
I totally agree with everything you said. TV        Reporters now a days, as a general rule, are talking heads in the TV News game.  Whatever journalism credentials they have are just good for the organization that employees them... then it can say '73% of our News Journalists are Professionally trained News Hounds'.... it's for PR and little else.   newlinechar  newlinechar Then the 'Reporter' just reads what ever is handed to him by somebody else... what he reads gets called the News, but it was written by somebody who wrote it based on some press release that was issued by the White House, Congressional Staff, or Company PR Flack, etc.  I we, as the public, are lucky... it includes info from each the White House, Congressional Staff and Company's Press Release all in the same report.  But more often than not, it only includes one side of the argument... that side being whichever is the one that best fits the parent corporations view, or wants to be viewed by the masses, as what is the truth.  
I think there's two very different things here. newlinechar  newlinechar Decriminalizing marijuana (or other stuff that is, by and large, mostly a matter of personal choice, say the amount of sexuality or violence in movies, videogames, books, etc) I am fully in favor of. newlinechar  newlinechar However, our current society is inherently complex and specialized to the extent that no individual, no matter how intelligent or well-informed, can possibly hope to be an expert on all areas (choice of medical treatment, appropriate financial products, etc).  So the *laissez faire* approach of saying that everything is the responsibility of the end consumer, and that there is nowhere a concept of fiduciary responsibility or professional ethics, is, in my view, fatally flawed. newlinechar  newlinechar Self-regulation, aka the foxes guarding the henhouse, is also inherently problematic.  While there are problems with [Regulatory Capture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) in government oversight, these occur more often in the US, where libertarian theology helps corporations, than in the other OECD nations.

As it turns out even JWs didn't buy this nonsense until well into the 20th century and it was a major shift in their thinking that had to do with one misguided leader, not the Bible or the founder of their sect: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;After Russell's death in 1916, Joseph Franklin Rutherford succeeded Russell as president of the Watchtower organization. Under his administration Jehovah’s Witnesses depicted uses of blood as heroic and the Lord’s work.[83][84] In 1925, blood transfusion was mentioned in an issue of Golden Age. It reported on Mr. B. W. Tibble who donated blood on forty-five separate occasions. The article highlighted his refusal of payment for donating, and the honor accordingly bestowed upon him by Order of the king.[85] In 1927 the Watchtower organization addressed blood, stating, “God told Noah that every living creature… must not eat the blood…”.[86] In 1931 this was expounded by the Watchtower organization teaching “that it was not the eating of the blood that God objected to, but it was bringing the blood of the beast in contact with the blood of man.”[87] At this time the Watchtower organization taught that human blood was sacred and that it was wrong to contaminate human blood with animal blood.[88] In 1940 while discussing interesting medical news, the Watchtower organization reported on a woman who accidentally shot herself with a revolver in her heart and survived a major surgical procedure during which an attending physician donated a quart of his own blood for transfusion.[89] newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;After Rutherford’s death in 1942, the Watchtower organization (under Nathan Homer Knorr’s administration) wrote in 1944, “the stranger was forbidden to eat or drink blood, whether by transfusion or by the mouth” and that this applied “in a spiritual way to the consecrated persons of good-will today, otherwise known as “Jonadabs” of the Lord’s “other sheep.””[90] In 1945, the application of the doctrine on blood was expanded to prohibit blood transfusions of whole blood, whether allogeneic or autologous. [91] While the prohibition didn't specify any punitive measures for accepting a transfusion, by January of 1961 it became a disfellowshipping offence to conscientiously accept a blood transfusion.[92] This represented an admitted shift toward increased strictness by the Watchtower organization imposing additional obligation upon the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses.[93]  newlinechar  newlinechar

Modern video compressors use both spacial and temporal compression - this means a region(s) of an individual frame can be compressed as well as parts of the image that stay the same through a given set of frames.  newlinechar  newlinechar A video 'block'(different terms for different encoders) is an atomic sequence of frames wrapped with information about the block and an index or key to tell the decoder where to place the block relative to other blocks, to form a time line or sequence of sorts.  newlinechar  newlinechar For streaming video sequencing gets complicated because blocks can arrive out of order or corrupted, meaning you have to re-transfer the block or wait until the appropriate one for the sequence shows up. To keep things playing smoothly streaming encoders have to reduce the size of the block so it's quicker to catch up or correct for it. This has several ramifications: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) You have more metadata because you have more blocks with accompanying indices and descriptors. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Because each block has to be atomic and because each block is smaller the temporal compression isn't as efficient -- you have a smaller 'dictionary' in which to find repetition. newlinechar  newlinechar In summary, more metadata and less efficient temporal compression are the reason that streaming downloads are larger. If you're going to do further research into this (I know some of you are) make sure to differentiate streaming and 'progressive download' encoding. Progressive download is a different beast altogether. newlinechar  newlinechar **EDIT:** newlinechar In relation to file systems, an inode is a data structure that contains metadata about a specific, fixed-size block of space on the storage device. It contains information like permissions, path, etc. This data structure is analogous to the one used in video encoding.  newlinechar  newlinechar The comment about smaller blocks pertains to how the file system is configured and how it works. I'm not a file system expert, so take this with a grain of salt - it's just my understanding of how they work: newlinechar  newlinechar  A file can span multiple inodes but it cannot span a fraction of an inode; that is, regardless of how small a file is, an entire inode (block) must be used to represent it.  newlinechar  newlinechar On older versions of NTFS and some EXT file systems, the default node capacity is 4096k. If you have a large collection of small files, this is very space inefficient because the entire 4096k is allocated even if the file is only a few kilobytes in length. To compensate for this, the node capacity can be reduced to make storage more efficient - the trade off is that you now have a larger percentage of space consumed by the metadata stored in each node. Same thing with video: smaller blocks = more metadata. newlinechar  newlinechar Newer file systems have sparse-file support, master databases, single instance storage, etc so the information I've presented here is not necessarily relevant any more. newlinechar  newlinechar **See:** [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_%28data_storage%29](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_%28data_storage%29)

As I pictured the thoughts I began to slow them down, the visual image of those thoughts slowing down over my forehead helped.  Eventually it slowed down enough to a point where you really aren't thinking of anything, and that's when you dive down into the Sub-Conscious.  You will feel this physically and mentally.  You will kind of feel you have felt this before, it's like a deja-vu.  Perhaps cause it's truly a part of you. newlinechar  newlinechar I feel that it's your thoughts that are stopping you most of the time to get to the core of the discovery process.

'The international legal rules governing the use of force take as their starting point Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which prohibits any nation from using force against another. The charter allows for only two exceptions to this rule: when force is required in self-defense (Article 51) or when the Security Council authorizes the use of force to protect international peace and security (Chapter VII).' Therefore the war is illegal by at least the UN's standards. Arguing the war is legal is like arguing waterboarding isn't torture. You can argue it but it goes against all logic and legal precedent.

They both want to grab all of the income of middle America and throw it into their pet programs.  I just happen to think that, very generally speaking, the way Democrats spend my money is better than the way Republicans do.  That and I'm very pro-social programs.  Could there be a Republican that I could support?  Sure!  I'm open to the idea.  There hasn't been one in the 21 years that I've been at or above the voting age though. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm a NY Giants fan.

The enemy of your enemy is not necessarily your friend.  What idiotic logic. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And I'm sorry, Paul being anti-war doesn't automatically catapult him to the top of the Republican list.

&gt; But since the local loan issuer wasn't assuming the risk, they changed the rules for individual risk assessment in order to sell more mortgages. newlinechar  newlinechar Yup.

Shorter helps, seeing as Pynchon manages to cram a novel's worth of information in less than a paragraph (and might teach you a new mathematical equation along the way).  Gravity's Rainbow at times feels like reading a novelized history of the entirety of Western civilization, including all the things its philosopher's pondered, its scientists invented, its politicians schemed, and its everyday folks feared and lusted after and obsessively dwelled on... plus the added intellectual tango of Pynchon turning all those ideas inside out and seeing how many different and newly illuminating ways they can be stacked up.  Which is awesome.  And also... ow, I think my brain just exploded.

Nuclear war has been averted due to MAD, mutually assured destruction. MAD only works if you believe in consequences for your actions. With a democracy where the government is responsible to the people, nuclear war simply cannot happen. People will not vote to annhilate themselves and use nuclear weapons pre-emptively.

What's so great about it?  I started it a few times, but it just didn't seem very compelling.
I never try to turn things into fights. If you'll check my post history, i think you'll note a consistent de-escalationist policy. newlinechar  newlinechar part of our disagreement is because i misinterpreted your (vaguely worded) statement about 'attempting to understand the nature of god'. you should be more careful about the use of pronouns for interchangeable parties. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I double-dog-dare you. newlinechar  newlinechar whip one out. check the section on 'newtonian mechanics'. now, find the part where it describes behavior at relatavistic speeds. what's that? how about the part where those equations dont work on other planets, or are not the same at different altitudes? (some books might mention that, but most don't). newlinechar  newlinechar you are making the SAME mistake you accuse me of. i do not imply that high school physics books contain all of, or substaintially represent science. they are simplifications, distillations of a complicated or abstract system into a set of rules to follow to arrive at an answer. as such, they are false in any situation which does not match the ones for which it was intended. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So, anybody that attempts to adhere to the rules of some religion is following something that's provably wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar you make a statement in which you make a parallel by replacing 'the rules of some religion' in a statement with 'something that is provably wrong'. you are therefore stating that religion is provably wrong. any 'fifth grader' would possibly have trouble articulating that idea - what exactly *were* you trying to say, if not that religions are proveably wrong? were you implying that *some religions* are provably wrong? let's go for non-obvious here. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You're failing to make a distinction between judging an idea to be wrong, versus not tolerating that idea at all. newlinechar  newlinechar you're failing to make a distinction between a group of people and an general class of ideas which they have in common. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Or, at least, provably false. newlinechar  newlinechar i'll need that definition of 'religion' here. i can do a more general proof that shows that, in order for this to be wrong, you have to define religion in a special way such that the two statements are the same (circular definition), but that's a much longer proof. toss me a definition and i'll have a go. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I can judge a particular idea to be wrong, without negatively judging the character of the person adhering to that idea. newlinechar  newlinechar yes, you can. but since you were defending the statement 'And BTW, the problem with religious people isn't that they're smug. It's that they're wrong.' I assumed that you agreed with it. You didn't personally say anything bigoted, I admit, but the statement you were defending was. newlinechar  newlinechar again, the part about 'The problem there is that we aren't attempting to understand the nature of God, we're merely attempting to sort out the rules he supposedly imposed on us.' was a misunderstanding, drop that section of discussion (you switched 'we' from meaning religious people to people in general, or scientific people between sentences there, and I didn't catch it)

That might cause a degradation of signal for everyone and be in nobodies interest then, for much the same reason that we all can't use the domain name www.microsoft.com.

Dave Ramsey makes the point that all of this consumer lending has only been going on for about the last 30 years for credit cards and only about 60-80 years for mortgages.  People had mortgages before then but it was considered a black mark against their character.  Sears actually used to say it was 'FOLLY TO BUY ON CREDIT' in their catalogs.  Now, Sears actually makes more with their consumer finance division than they do selling actual merchandise.  James Cash Penny did not allow people to purchase things on credit from his company while he was alive.  Americans really need to wake up to this. newlinechar  newlinechar http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9050474362583451279 newlinechar  newlinechar and  newlinechar  newlinechar http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1828764955204524646 newlinechar  newlinechar Also, think about this, especially after watching the first video.  Think of all those credit card applications you get now.  If that it not the video proving it's point, I don't know what is.  Most of those cards are backed by fractional reserve banking.  So in effect when you use them to purchase merchandise, labor, etc. you are causing inflation and increasing the money supply.  In effect, destroying the value of the dollar and your savings.  Don't believe me, take a look at how many loaves of bread, gallons of milk or gas $10,000 in savings would have purchased even just 5 years ago and compare to now. Even worse, some people are now using the 12months zero percent balance transfer to extract money from the credit card and invest it in a savings account, borrowing from their home equity to invest, borrowing, borrowing, borrowing.  This allows the banks to loan or create even more money because the money ends up going into savings or checkings and into their reserves.  Sounds exactly like what was happening with stocks in the Great Depression all over again.  It is just happening with the banks instead of private investors doing it.    Think of that times the zillions of new credit cards approved each day.  RON PAUL 2008!  It is the only answer.  Someone like him comes along once in a blue moon.  He is smart and he has integrity.  He wants to stop spending and shrink government.  Restore faith in the US Dollar.  It has to start there.   newlinechar

Well, since my father teaches at a school district in Florida, I  tuned into the bit about the 'Florida Local Government Investment Pool' and googled up this Bloomberg article: newlinechar  newlinechar [Florida Halts Withdrawals From Local Investment Fund (Update3) ](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601170&amp;refer=home&amp;sid=aDdJ4GDZ6eao) newlinechar  newlinechar It seems to me to be an examination of one situation that is likely going on all over the place.  When school teachers have their paychecks held up due to the liquidity crisis you know the sh** is going to hit the fan politically. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a slow motion crash winding its way through the system as all these credit vehicles get marked down.  New accounting rules force companies and funds to value assets more according to their market value and this leads to rapid destruction of notional wealth.  There is no ticker like the DOW or S&amp;P500 to watch, but if there was, what would it look like? newlinechar  newlinechar What does it mean to have $18 Billion in a fund if the securities in the fund cannot be liquidated at any price, even if the underlying debt is being serviced somewhat or even completely?  What is the value?  Is it a 'hiccup' or is it really gone?  What if you are relying on it for 'cash management' purposes with the idea that it is low risk and you can make withdrawals as easily as from a checking account?  Ooops.  No you can't.  What other moves will you have to make to adjust and what will be the consequences of those emergency moves? newlinechar  newlinechar It seems to me, a lot of responsible people (CFO's, trustees, fund managers) must be freaking out.

when there was nothing there was no time. time began with the universe. If you have self-consciousness  you already have a self, a consciousness  and the division between two. That is the core of the matter-spirit dilemma, so again if universe is conscious now, it does not mean that consciousness existed before the universe appeared, or that there was another consciousness that produced this one.  newlinechar  newlinechar However interesting representation exist in the Indian mythology, where Brahma dreams the reality and all the other gods and objects in it. There is no way we can disprove that we are not subjects of such a dream, nor can  we prove  that we are (a matrix without an escape route). newlinechar  newlinechar If you are interested in cosmology I can highly recommend the last Alex Vilenkin's book 'Many Worlds in One' (ISBN 0809067226). Popular science literature is way better read than any ID nonsense.   newlinechar  newlinechar Again, sorry if I was unclear, please don't forget that there are spiritual teachings that very much relay on the existence of evolution (i.e. Sri Aurobindo). What is evolving can be debatable and questioned, yes. But evolution itself is a proven fact, thus rendering any ID or creationism mumbling  a pile of psychotic crap.

It gets more in federal spending than it brings in. Paul's district gets a large amount of pork, even by those standards.

&gt;For example, the fact that you can commit to multiple branches at the same time is pretty ugly (and it will haunt you when the time comes you want to migrate to a DVCS). newlinechar  newlinechar But that issue was a deliberate design choice that is optional to use… I was more thinking of flaws you have to work around, such as CVS's inability to delete folders. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying that SVN is without problems; like any reasonably complex piece of software, it is full of issues and limitations.

Of course they aren't independent. If it was as easy as my example, no quant would be making $300,000/year. newlinechar  newlinechar A (properly designed) MBS should track the housing market (roughly), adjusted for interest rate and risk.

Even a properly designed MBS based on good data will suck at that point.

I like LispWorks. Great implementation, great development environment, native code compiler, lots of useful stuff included, excellent debugger, excellent support. Creates double-clickable apps. Cross-platform GUI. Cross platform IDE. Has a 64Bit version, too. Has database access, threading, delivery, rule system, and so on. newlinechar Installs with a simple installer (at least that was what I used under Mac OS X and Windows). newlinechar  newlinechar A good alternative to that is Allegro CL. It seems to have more libraries in some areas. newlinechar  newlinechar Currently I'm using OpenMCL quite a bit. Installs from a disk image like a normal Mac application. Double-Clickable.

Native code compiler, supports threading on multiple cores, excellent GC, 64 and 32bit versions, better IDE under development, 'free'. newlinechar  newlinechar For SBCL there are some simple to install packages. newlinechar  newlinechar For library support many people use ASDF - runs with several implementations. For the IDE, the free choice is SLIME + Emacs. Works also for many implementations. For a good intro read Peter Seibel's book Practical Common Lisp. That should get you started.

my point was, in languages that don't guarantee tail call optimisation (either in the spec, the way scheme does, or de facto by having the single implementation be the 'spec'), you have to actually write your code differently. it may be a behind the scenes detail in terms of interpreter/compiler implementation, but it obtrudes itself upon the user's notice

It is not surprising that so many of us are unmarried in our mid-thirties when children today are not seen as a blessing but rather a burden or even a guilty indulgence, when marriage is seen as a prison rather than a partnership, when taxes sap half our income making it harder and more stressful to support a family without two full-blown-career incomes, when men and women regard each other with suspicion, when we compete rather than cooperate... I could go on.  The case for marriage doesn't seem to be a good one -- at least for men.  I want to believe in it.   I keep wondering if someone will show me what would be so great about it...

I'll begin with an apology for taking what, in retrospect, does appear to be a condescending tone. It doesn't further debate and certainly wasn't my intention from the outset.   newlinechar    newlinechar I'll address the point of contention concerning Iraq's post-war situation first. I'm afraid I would have to disagree in the strongest possible terms that it is 'difficult to say the invasion has made things worse'. Which is no mean feat considering the state of the country following ten years of sanctions, effectively crippling the country socially and economically. I'm not sure how it would be possible to conclude that life for the average Iraqi citizen was improved by the invasion. The human cost in the post-invasion years is perhaps the most damning aspect. I'm sure you're aware of the Hopkins studies, the latest of which in October 2006 suggesting a figure for deaths attributable to violence ranging between 426,369 and 793,663. In addition to the direct loss of life the effect on social infrastructure has be devastating. The limited social programs that were in place before the war became unsustainable. Right through to January 2007 electricity generation had fallen below pre-war levels. The majority of the country still lacks sanitation, 32% of the population have access to clean drinking water, 19% have access to a sewage system. There is a national shortage of food, 25% are totally dependent on emergency rations. I don't think it would be unreasonable to suggest a large percentage of the population will be forced to forgo a formal education. In Baghdad 75% of children no longer attend school, following the invasion over half Iraq's schools were declared in need of rebuilding, literacy levels are now lower among 15 year olds than 35 year olds.   newlinechar    newlinechar Moving on to the sociological effects on Iraqi society. Preceding the war, Iraq was one of, if not the only secular society in the region. The majority of Iraqis identified nationally and not along religious lines. The result of the infrastructural breakdown, outlined in the previous paragraph, and creation of a power vacuum has formented the sectarian conflict that has engulfed Iraq. Which leads into my claim that the invasion of Iraq has 'increased terrorism and nuclear proliferation worldwide'. I can't claim credit for this statement though as I'm essentially paraphrasing the CIA and practically every other intelligence agency, specialist/committee on international affairs in the world. The reasons for the increase are fairly straightforward. Partly for revenge, in the case of low-level terrorism, but on the issue of international terrorism and proliferation it is a question of self-defense. I fear this is getting a little long winded but I'll be happy to elaborate on that.   newlinechar    newlinechar For me the tangible costs of the 'just war' type intervention that took place in Iraq are insurmountable when offset against the potential benefits. To move on to my second point and return somewhat to my suggestion that the US has acted contrary to preventing human rights abuses, there are dozens of questionable examples but I'll begin with one close the previous topic. Saddam was eventually convicted for the crimes he committed in 1982, accurately so. Coincidently 1982 was the year Iraq was dropped from the list of states supporting terrorism. And support continued right through 87 and 88 when he was gassing the Kurds, perhaps 100,000, but the US didn't object. The administration at the time actually successfully blocked congressional efforts to even protest Iraq's use of chemical weapons against civilians let alone take action.   newlinechar    newlinechar This sort of selective recognition wasn't what I was really alluding to though. To get a true grasp of the inaction and active contempt for humanitarian concerns the US has shown in its foreign policy you have to look toward its record at the UN. The US leads every nation by far in its use of the veto, for starters it's easy to show that until recently the US has blocked every Middle East peace proposal thats been forwarded. There is comprehensive evidence of inaction on the United States behalf in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Declassified State Department documents show that the US applied diplomatic pressure at the UN to discourage intervention during the peak of the attrocities.   newlinechar    newlinechar Another example that is often described as an altruistic intervention is the deployment of troops to Somalia during the famine in 1992. What isn't mentioned is that the US was the chief supporter of the Somali Warlord Said Barre from 1978 through to 1990, While he destroyed the country and slaughtered around fifty thousand people. When the proxy regime collapsed in 91' the US simply pulled out and the country descended into civil war. The US still refrained from acting as the famine and fighting reached its peak in the first half of 1992. However elections rolled around in November and suddenly troops were deployed, unfortunately the famine was almost over by this time and the troops probably did more harm than good. Its actually possibly the troop deployment re-escalated the violence, US government reports suggesting 6,000 to 10,000 casualties. The point is there was a much better alternative. The bombing of Kosovo in 1999 is another example of intervening to exacerbate the problem. Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Haiti, East Timor a plethora of SE Asian countries. There really are a wealth of cases.    newlinechar    newlinechar Let me know if you require sources for anything I've claimed above.

Thats an interesting position to hold, because it is the logic used by the neocons and anyone else that wants to shape other communities in their image. Your assumption is that Pakistan can't be trusted to respect the power of a nuclear weapon, while the USA can.

Holy fucking humble batman.  That thing is amazing.

Governments are notorious for changing requirements mid-stream.  Product developed by third party is not quite what they had in mind, so gov reworks requirements.

I realize its manifestly unpopular.  I hated this book with a passion when I read it in high school.  I couldn't understand why anyone would want to read such a dry, dusty piece of literature.  Then, in college, I took a course of independent study where a professor picked all of my books and the first one on the list was The Scarlet Letter.  Upon re-reading it, outside of the hellish confines of high school, I personally found the book to be fascinating.  The prose is quite good, if you can get past the articulation of the time period.  Also, the way Hawthorne writes the book, something will happen in the story that was based on some passing mention of fact earlier in the story, so that the ending sequences are perfectly crafted.  You get the impression at the end that no author could have achieved that particular emotional exchange between the characters at the book's end.  Pick it up the next time you're at a book store and read three pages.  If it wasn't taught in high school English class, people would think its a cool book.

No, no, no. You don't understand. This how Scientology *works*. They never defend or explain *themselves*. They don't pick the attacks which are *accurate*. They pick the ones which *transfer attention*, the ones which raise eyebrows, which force the attacked party to turn around and defend themself in turn. Once this is done, suddenly the spotlight has shifted and the *other* guy is red-faced and the original attack on Scientology has been successfully defused. Calling the proposal 'incomprehensible' does just this: it diverts all attention to the proposal rather than Scientology. This is an explicit part of the way the COS operates: 'Always attack, never defend.' It's subtle, and you have to be able to recognise it.

Here's my problem with the whole 'God did it' thing. Even if you do allow that to answer your questions about science, it still opens up hundreds of new questions about God and his motivations, nature and capability which are unanswered either by science or by religious text. newlinechar  newlinechar Is God infinite? If the universe is finite, where does God keep the rest of himself? Is he three-dimensional? Four? Can he travel through time? Can he travel back in time to see his past self? If so, what happens to the timeline? If not, why not? If God is an infinite presence, in what sense is he present in the real world? Does he give off heat? Does he interact with ordinary matter in a manner which can be tested for? Has he mass? Does he have an electric charge, or is he electrically neutral? Why'd he create the universe in the first place? Did he create other intelligent life forms on other planets? Why did he start out with one legal system and then replace it with another one, instead of starting out with the working one from minute one? Why create humans at all? At what point in their evolution did humans acquire souls, and why do humans have them but not animals? Are we even sure about that? Why are humans created in need of redemption when they could have just been happy forever? Why let the Fall happen? Why does God need praising? Why is prayer necessary if God already knows what you want and what you need better than you do? If he is good and omnipotent, why is there evil? Is he partially evil or limited in his powers? If the answer is 'free will', why is freedom to do evil better than eternal happiness? And why were humans built without free will? Doesn't that mean they were built imperfect? And so on, and so on...

No on-chip cache (L1 or L2) today is DRAM.  DRAM is still largely incompatible with high-performance CMOS used for making processors.  The reason cache hasn't scaled as much as the rest of processor 'power' (speed, bit-width, etc.) is that bigger caches get slower (relative to the processor speed) thereby ceasing to be effective caches.

And, again; the consistency in substance use &amp; abuse given the relative levels of criminal &amp; fiscal punitive measures dictates that the criminalization accomplishes nothing more than making the client society feel as though it is punishing the wicked or protecting the weak from themselves.

&gt;For a 32-bit OS you need a x86-32 CPU newlinechar  newlinechar You actually need a CPU that will run the 32 bit software.  Assuming we're talking about 32 bit Windows, then yes, an x86-32 is sufficient.    But one of the features of the x86-64 CPUs is that they're backward compatible with the x86-32 instruction set.  So an x86-64 CPU is also usable with a 32 bit Windows OS. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;for a 64-bit OS you need a x86-64 CPU newlinechar  newlinechar Yep. newlinechar  newlinechar You said: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And if you buy a 64-bit CPU and then install a 32-bit OS, you shouldn't be allowed near a computer.

If you do, make sure you get the right OS. newlinechar  newlinechar tzk replied with: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Where can I find a 32bit only CPU... that's new. newlinechar  newlinechar The implication (and it was fairly obvious) was that it's no longer possible to buy new 32 bit CPUs.  If we follow your reasoning about 32 bit OS only on 32 bit CPU and 64 bit OS only on 64 bit CPU, then noone from here on will be able to run 32 bit Windows. newlinechar  newlinechar While you did not actually type '32 bit CPU' in your original post, it was clear from your words that you intended that anyone who wanted to run a 32 bit OS needs to buy a 32 bit CPU.  tzk pointed out that is no longer feasible. newlinechar

I worked briefly for my high school district after I graduated, building some of their first computer lab networks.  (The very first I did while I was student) newlinechar  newlinechar A significant part of our project was halted for _6_ weeks during the summer because their electricians were never available.  I harassed the administration about it almost daily, and they acted like it was completely out of their hands.  It's basically an environment where nobody is accountable for anything.  Everybody's jobs are indefinitely secure until America collapses and they behave accordingly. newlinechar  newlinechar I was being paid on an overall contract basis, not hourly, so I basically absorbed the cost in wasted time.  When the electricians finally showed up, they gave no notice.  If I weren't there, they probably would have just left or screwed it up.

SBCL is faster than Strongtalk and its dynamically typed, for example. Besides the current Strongtalk implementation is buggy and incomplete (for example, there's no auto GC trigger, so unless you GC manually you just run out of heap.) newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with Smalltalk, Python and Ruby in general is that because _every_ call is a dynamic message send, there are fewer opportunities for static analysis. Runtime-driven optimizations only get you so far, and come with a hefty price: startup and 'warmup' time. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure having so much dynamism in the language is actually beneficial. Dynamic typing is great, but being able to make guarantees to the compiler is just as important.

The 'vast majority of idiots' are touched by power, and I really doubt that degrees or much bigger pay would significantly dent the power of power to make people lose it.

Actually it is. The modern usage of the word is inaccurate. A monopoly is a state grant that guarantees that a service must be provided through a certain source.

After all, you and spez are the only two persons I've ever seen who's been vigorously defending Facebook's lies ('[this is opt-in](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/coke-is-holding-off-on-sipping-facebooks-beacon/)', 'we don't receive information if people opt out') by putting the full blame on the people they lied to ('had they looked at the code, they'd seen that it was sending the information to facebook').  And you keep doing that even after Facebook has [backed off](http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=7188).  What are we missing here?
It's unlikely that it uses reflection any more than the rest of the runtime. The JVM isn't bad for dynamic code generation and loading. It's not good either, by any stretch of the imagination, but the basic classloader architecture makes it entirely possible to emit bytecode at runtime and load that as new classes.

I've written to Orrin Hatch about these concepts specifically (riders, massive complex bills, and not reading bills before passage). newlinechar  newlinechar His response was unfortunately pretty patronizing, in that he recommended I not overly concern myself with such matters, as congress pretty much knows what it is doing. newlinechar  newlinechar It pissed me off.

You read articles about American kids 'growing up so fast,' but I think the opposite is true.  The persistent sheltering and excessive scheduling of kids is extending childhood at least through college, if not further. newlinechar  newlinechar If teenagers really were adults, they wouldn't have any problem with the 'my roof, my rules' attitude of their parents.  I mean, when an adult stays at someone's house as a guest, don't they adapt to the household's customs? newlinechar  newlinechar The poster that started all this makes a valid point--a lot of quarrelsome teenagers claim they should be 'treated more like adults,' when in fact what they really want is the benefits of adulthood with none of the costs. newlinechar  newlinechar I my opinion, it's not parents that make being a teenager suck, it's high school.  For some reason American's think it's a good idea  to stick 2,000 teenagers in a building with less than 200 adults to supervise them.  What you end up with is a micro-society *defined by children*.

Well obviously everyone in the world is incapable of proactive action for themselves.  They only can *react* to Western powers or other powers. newlinechar  newlinechar Why do you decide that other cultures and peoples are too ignorant or infantile to act on their own accord.

Sorry but I was personally in those hearings when Victoria Toensing stated flatly that Plame was not covert. She was a drafter of the secrecies act. (Oh man the DEM's in the room went crazy). It was a political show event of the highest order. Each party literally falling all over itself to make political capital out of the event. The bottom line cam during Toensing's testimony. When the actual law was cited it became clear to everyone in the room that there simply was no case. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar She pointed out (contrary to plame's testimony) that while Plame may have traveled. She had not within 5 years. Novak was argueing on the side how only an idiot would believe that a covert agent would be going to work at the CIA building every day much less be in the country. In fact he correctly pointed out in march of this year that no evidence that she was covert was even presented to a jury. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Besides think about it. There is no more court case, no more investigations for trial, nothing. It's over. Nobody is going after Armatage who was the actual leaker. Why isn't he being put on trial? Why isn't anyone at all being put on trial, or even charged for that matter? All you have now is DEM's in congress screaming about 'we need more documentation from the White House'. It's crap. The whole thing. If the White house coughs up more emails then pow! DEM's will find some other scandal to yell about. That's DC politics. They pontificate and make make assertions via questions like 'shouldn't the public have a right to know'?. Party line editorialists pick it up and make a public case and people who hate Bush scream about treason and betrayal. Everybody sites tons of 'proof' to make their case and then DC moves on to the next scandal. GOP did it to Clinton, DEM's did it to Bush and the next president will get the same treatment because it is all about power here. Seats = power. Power=ability to implement legislation and dictate the course for the sheeple. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

I appreciate the well thought out response. newlinechar  newlinechar I cannot deny that the US has made a variety of mistakes in foreign policy with its attempts at *real politik*.  Many times, the US tried to choose the best of two horrible options (which is sometimes necessary). newlinechar  newlinechar I'd be interested to see sources for the Somalian and the Rwanada assertions as I had not heard those. newlinechar  newlinechar As far as Middle East peace, you will most likely disagree, but the UN is not exactly unbiased.  I have contempt for the organization's inaction, and frankly I also have contempt for the massive scandals that the organization has been involved in with tyrants and dictators, as well as the power given to power-hungry nations to overrule humanitarian efforts (the US included) and the voice given to other tyrants, dictatorships, and regimes actively violating human rights conventions.  No governing body can be taken seriously under such conditions, especially when no 'advanced' nation condemns such idiocies other than the US and a few others. newlinechar  newlinechar Given that, any Middle East peace agreement by the UN needs to be taken with a grain of salt.  Israel has made mistakes, but the UN passes more resolutions against Israel than *any nation on Earth.*  We can argue whether Israel has done some horrible things and deserves it, but there are *much much much* worse regimes that are ignored, and even given speaking time, in the General Assembly.  When the UN treats Israel and Palestine equally, I'll take it more seriously.  Until it condemns Palestinian terrorist activity and human rights violations with the same passion as its virulently anti-semitic members condemn Israel, I will ignore it. newlinechar  newlinechar My altruistic examples were South Korea and Bosnia, and I haven't seen any rebuttal to them.  I am not challenging them, but I appreciate your responses. newlinechar  newlinechar I think its up for debate, obviously, but my opinion is that the US has done more good for the world than bad.  Many people disagree with that and you may be one of them, but no country can be perfect.  We had to choose to ally with Stalin in WW2 because it was arguably the lesser of two evils.  Sometimes the real world dictates those decisions, and many times we make the wrong decisions or self-serving decision.  But I think the US is one of the only, if not the only, nation that has the *ability* to engage in altruistic interventions that *does* engage in them, even if all of them are not.

&gt; we just have a good idea that lots more CO2 is a bad thing in the long run. newlinechar  newlinechar So its not solid research, but a good idea.

There have been occasions where we have made things worse for local ecosystems by messing with the natural order of things (e.g. pesticides). So to me the logical course of action is to focus on fuel efficiency before throwing money at the issue of global warming. The fuel efficiency will benefit us immediately and the warmer issue we don't know what if any benefit will be achieved.

_We simply cannot afford to lock up every felon for life._ newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, if we decided to decriminalize drug use, we'd have __plenty__ of prison space to lock up all felons for life. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, it could well be argued that we've completely over-built the prison system in the first place.  I think even if you factor out the drug-related offenses, we're still imprisoning people at a much higher rate per-capita than any other western country. newlinechar  newlinechar _If we crucify every governor who makes a parole or pardon decision that turns out badly in hindsight, we're going to discourage any exercise of discretion in this field. The result won't be that the criminal justice system just keeps everybody locked up forever; rather, the result will be that the system will be administered by unaccountable, faceless board members with no aspirations to electoral office._ newlinechar  newlinechar I definitely agree. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know if Huckabee has done this, but talking forthrightly about the parole incident, and what he's learned from it (from all different angles), I think would help a lot.

You shouldn't assume people are staking a claim on your land, but you also shouldn't assume people aren't staking a claim on your land.  newlinechar  newlinechar Your right I don't know these people. They did the 'Good American Thing', that is they paid their taxes and kept up their fences(maybe? cause if they did how did they not know their land was being used for 20 plus years, how did they not see the paths.) From what I am assuming these people did very little on this land other than a day or twos work every couple of years.  People still need to protect their own land and their property(don't assume violence please, simple communication does this) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now I know the Kirlins kept their fences up, but it was not mentioned in the article that Mclean and Stevens jumped a small fence. There was also not a no trespassing sign posted(I just reread it to make sure).   newlinechar  newlinechar As far as your last comment goes, I don't think you understand the law.  If the landowner says, 'you can use my land, or you can't use my land. Then this law is voided, individuals can't squat when there has been some type of intervention.  When no intervention is made for long periods of time, then you run into a situation like this.   newlinechar  newlinechar There is something said about knowing your neighbors.

&gt; You may be aware that 'revenge' is reactive. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, but it has no goal unlike most other holy wars. I don't think any terrorist believes that they are converting people.

Pretty soon we'll all be blind.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You are not taking Islamic Radicals seriously because you ignore half the things they say (all of the parts about infidels, hating Jews, stoning women who go into public without a male family member, Caliphates, 12th Imams, etc) newlinechar  newlinechar I ignore this because I hear the exact same things from Christians regularly. A guy was stoned to death in England this year, though not for religious reasons. There are many preachers in the US that think women should be subservient. The problem is that we give the islamic retards airtime. It would be the same as allowing the head of the KKK to speak for Christianity.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; They have attacked or attempted to attack many Western nations, not just the US.  newlinechar  newlinechar Only ones that have directly attacked them. The July 7th London bombings were the UKs first ever Islamic attacks, meanwhile the Glasgow airport attack was Scotland's first ever terrorist attack in our entire history going back to the stone age. newlinechar  newlinechar They also attack Russia, largely for their actions in places like Afghanistan and Spain for being involved in Iraq (like the UK). newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand I could list off a hundred countries that they don't attack. Most of these countries have the same religion and core beliefs as the UK and the USA, only an imbecile would believe 'they hate freedom' as a rationale.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The US just happens to be the most powerful and is easy to focus newlinechar  newlinechar Have you even looked at the list on the wiki page? If I was from any one of these countries I'd hate America too. You replaced benevolent democratically elected leaders with megalomaniacal despotic dictators purely for your own strategic or ideological needs.

I've never read anything as brutal as that from Islamic history. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You may be aware that the Crusades were a delayed response to Islamic aggression. newlinechar  newlinechar Really? Or Islamic *expansion* through *conversion*. Big difference, though I admit I may be wrong in this respect, it's far from my specialist subject.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I am not sure where you get the idea that I am anti-Islamic  newlinechar  newlinechar Quote: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; &gt; Believe it or not, Islamicists (not all Muslims, only the extreme ones) have been slaughtering infidels for centuries.  newlinechar  newlinechar Your use of 'infidels' as a derogatory term kind-of gives it away.

No, they are not silenced. But they should not be taken seriously until they put down the dogma and think objectively. The reason ID is derided so much is that it is utter moronic and calling it science is an insult to science.  newlinechar  newlinechar Science is about as far from closed as you can get. The fundamental point of the subject is to learn and the only way to do that is to allow yourself to change opinions based on observable evidence. There hasn't been any against Darwinian evolution however there has been almost infinite new evidence that continually backs up the theory. For example, DNA and the heritory process in general wasn't even fully agreed upon in Darwin's time.  newlinechar  newlinechar Science isn't a belief system. Changing your opinions on things doesn't affect whether you get eternal salvation or eternal damnation. Scientists do not have the same investment in their beliefs that ID'ers have.

If he lent his car knowing that a robbery was going to take place, it makes him an accomplise. However, the punishment should match the actions.

Actually, until I read it I was of the opinion that it was just a study group, one of those gestural resolutions that congressmen can wave at  specific groups of constituents to show they are doing something.

It's a badly written law that looks much too much like a commission created to draft a framework for creating a class of political crimes and drafting legal policies that would make that class of crimes (prior to any violent action) a cause for arrest and detention.

Specifically, NIST's interim report on 7 World Trade Center displays photographs of the southwest façade of the building that show it to have significant damage.

Copyright infringement is not theft (even though you can say 'You stole my idea!'). Nor is murder theft (even though you can say 'You stole his life!'). Neither of these claims implies anything about the morality of the act in question. 
Depending on the person, I would have no reason to think something that serious would be nothing but a joke. Even when sober. It is ridiculous to think that if they do happen to carry out what I had thought they were joking about, and it resulted in a death, that I should be punished for it for nothing more than letting who I thought was a friend go pick up some food or something to that effect when jokingly saying he is going to rob a house on the way out the door.  newlinechar  newlinechar Once again, the rest of the world 'gets it' but the US doesn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is one of those older laws that violates civil liberties more now than ever before.

That is just lewd.

Yes, I work for Reddit, which is owned by CondeNet, which has a commercial relationship with Facebook.  However, that wouldn't change my opinion, and I thought it was common knowledge and didn't need to be explained. newlinechar  newlinechar What you are missing is that the Facebook PR people do not know how to explain to the unwashed masses what Javascript is and how it works with Beacon, and how it is the other site owner's fault that they did not respect their own users' privacy.  I don't blame them, since clearly most of the developers don't get it either. newlinechar  newlinechar Here is how the beacon works:  The site owner includes some javascript from Facebook, which sends them a bunch of data, including your cookie.  This is clearly explained in the developer docs.  Now, the naive site owner simply includes this javascript on every page rendering (like Hotwire).  newlinechar  newlinechar The right way to do Beacon would be to ask your users if they want this on, and THEN include the javascript only after they had opted in on the 3rd party site.  This is how Reddit was going to do it.  You would have had to check a box in your preferences before we ever even include the javascript, because we understand how Javascript works and how if we included it every time, then Facebook would get a lot of data that you don't want them to have.

&gt;I believe that the dominoes were 'divinely' set in motion at some point before the big bang if that's how you want to put it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Thats something that many people believe, but I cannot see it being much different than intelligent design. At superficial levels there is difference in that technically it doesn't need id concepts such as 'irreducible complexity'. newlinechar  newlinechar The evolutionary theory says we are explained by an unthinking process which progressed with no goal in mind. When you have God stacking divine dominoes before the Big Bang this is no longer true.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example, the reason that almost everyone has back-problems is easily explained by the fact we evolved from species that walked on all fours, an action which places less stress on our spinal cord. However the evolutionary advantages of walking upright were just big enough to offset the disadvantages of back problems. This explanation doesn't really work that well if you have God 'stacking dominoes', because all of a sudden you're left with the question 'Why did God 'stack the dominoes' in a such a way as to leave us with bodies that are so easily susceptible to back problems' and also 'Why did he create our bodies so that the most obvious and logically sound explanation of back problems requires his non-existence'. Any answer you come up with becomes really cumbersome, and the clean evolutionary explanation doesn't work any longer because that explanation requires that there was no intelligent input into the design of our bodies, whether we were designed ahead of the Big Bang, 15 billion years ago, or whether we were guided into our present form over the ages.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Intelligent design as its defined is a pretty unsophisticated wannabe theory. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree. The ways in which intelligent design is wrong are very subtle - its not creationism with its blatant idiotic claims of the world being only 6000 years old.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But at some point, cyclical universes or not, we're going to hit a brick wall - that's god. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Even if thats true (and it doesn't have to be true), it most likely won't be any of the Gods from the any of the religions on Earth.

If I steal your car, you no longer have a car. This is a clear and obvious negative impact on you. If I 'steal' your 'intellectual property' (another problematic term), you still *have* what I stole.

But I am open to the possibility that things are no longer getting even more hellish in Iraq... of course, it's hellish enough as it is, so that would be small comfort to those living there. newlinechar  newlinechar A small mountain of evidence has piled up that indicate that Iraq is far worse off since we came: newlinechar  newlinechar * Iraq veteran suicides and PTSS. newlinechar * Evidence of torture and illegal detention. newlinechar * Soaring per-capita murder rates. newlinechar * Vastly increased tribal tension/civil war. newlinechar * War profiteering/mercenary abuses. newlinechar * Vast war debt. newlinechar  newlinechar *Extraordinarily* worse. These aren't just talking points or blurbs spouted by a talking head... all the items listed above are proven facts that can be independently researched and verified. Any opposing viewpoint will need to provide a similarly broad and comprehensive mound of evidence to the contrary for me to believe it. newlinechar  newlinechar So you see, it's not that we don't know other viewpoints exist... it's that we don't view them with the same respect we hold for viewpoints that have *facts* to back them up.
&gt; The biggest problem with parents is that because they learned that the issues they dealt with as teens were basically inconsequential, they fail to be empathic enough that the teen feels they are taken seriously. newlinechar  newlinechar That is true. It's sometimes hard for us to take a teenager's problems seriously when we have to deal with bills, taxes, jobs, and other such stuff. So we sometimes do tend to fail somewhat on that issue.

&gt; &gt; Science isn't a belief system. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Of course it is. It is faith in the Scientific Method as a methodology to knowledge. newlinechar  newlinechar I cannot agree with that. That's like saying 'the sky is blue' is a belief.  newlinechar  newlinechar Show me a single doubt in 'The Scientific Method' and I'll maybe agree. The process itself is factual, not based on belief. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; For example, let's take global warming researchers. Those researching climate change that are getting funding from the government or private enterprise have to find evidence of climate change to keep their funding! newlinechar  newlinechar That's corruption and unethical. Part of the standard scientific method is to 'check sources' and that also includes the character and integrity of the source.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If Darwinism was proven to be false or major holes were found in it, a lot of researchers and the foundations of their research would disappear... a life's work for many. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, we should just give up all science then? newlinechar  newlinechar If that's your reason for doubting Darwinism then I doubt your reason. Entire branches of science have been rendered irrelevant by later advances. We still revere the original authors as they made their theories to the best of the knowledge of the time.  newlinechar  newlinechar If compelling evidence came along to suggest Darwinism was false, any scientists that remained in that camp would be ridiculed. This is why we ridicule people who believe in ID. 
Which doesn't actually mention the GPL violation.
&gt; Ya know, part of the problem with parent/teenager relationships is that both sides are unwarrantedly arrogant and less than empathetic. newlinechar  newlinechar That's not really true. Parents are, for the most part, certainly empathetic to their kids' needs, for the simple reason that they truly love them. Anyone who has children understands this; parental love is, without a doubt, the purest, most potent form  of love that the human mind is capable of. newlinechar  newlinechar And I don't think that teenagers aren't empathetic to their parents, either. They're just doing what they're genetically programmed to do at adolescence: break away from the family group and try to form their own path.
I think you are on to something here. The perfect machine version of this would use a perfectly thin band with no force required to bend it and no stretch.  newlinechar  newlinechar A thin metal band will not be strong and a thick metal band will require a lot of force to wrap it around the rollers. The problem of metal fatigue also comes to mind. newlinechar  newlinechar multiple bands could be used to increase strength but would reduce stroke length.
Exactly. Banks could make riskier loans and still earn a profit (or so they thought). This resulted in an increase in the number of people who could qualify for loans. A good number of these people couldn't actually afford the loans they received, but the banks didn't care. newlinechar  newlinechar An increase in buyers results in an increase in prices due to competition. Where previously someone making $70k a year could buy a house at $250k, now he/she has to outbid someone making $40k/yr who's willing to take out an ARM. newlinechar  newlinechar Eventually, one of two things will happen: banks will realize that they are losing money to people who can't afford their mortgages, or homebuyers will become smarter and realize that ARMs are horribly expensive. As usually happens, human stupidity beats out human intelligence, so we're seeing the former. Banks grossly overestimated how much profit they could make on subprimes, which is why you can't get one anymore. newlinechar  newlinechar This means that there's no longer a $40k/yr buyer that you need to outbid. There never should have been in the first place. That was the artificial foundation.

&gt;130K on a 30 Year loan at about 6.5% Interest will cost them about $1100/month. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Rent, in some cases, is easily that much. newlinechar  newlinechar In an area where you can buy a home for $150K, I find it hard to believe that rent would be $1100/mo.  And they'll be paying utilities, taxes, and maintenance on top of that. newlinechar 
So you missed how many floors were on fire? For seven hours? How much resistance do you think a structure weakened by seven hours of fire puts up? newlinechar  newlinechar That's right, none. newlinechar  newlinechar The very fact that after heavy damage it stood for seven hours is a testament to how well it was built, actually. Everyone was evacuated, no one was hurt.
I stand by my previous statement. newlinechar  newlinechar No back seat of a Chevy, no parents, no Mr. Holle, no crime.
The Day God Was Born:  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Long ago, primitive people lived in caves. They had few rules and no religion. The operative social principle was 'might makes right.' The biggest and strongest men got first crack at the women and the food, and they slept closest to the fire. The small and weak got food scraps and slept in the cold dank areas of the cave. The biggest and strongest men feared only one thing, the thing that everyone in the cave feared: thunder. When thunder occurred, EVERYONE rushed to the back of the cave, even the big and the strong.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar After thousands of generations, a small man was born who was slightly smarter (due to mutation) than his cave mates. He had the ability to notice correlations between events better than other cave people. He began to notice that every time thunder happened, certain other things happened shortly before. For example, the wind began to blow harder, the temperature outside grew colder, the sky grew dark, and the birds stopped flying around.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar One day, when he noticed these signs beginning, he stood up in the front of the cave and announced, 'From now on, I get first crack at the women, the food, and the fire!' All of the big, strong men laughed at him. Then, the small man said, 'If you do not give me what I demand, my friend Thunder will come here and chase you all to the back of the cave!' Again the big men laughed. Then, the thunder came and everyone ran in terror to the back of the cave. From then on, the small man who could talk to Thunder got whatever he wanted. And that was the day God was born.

OK I will try to find time to watch the video, as long as it's not the one with Kirk Cameron trying to say the (man-modified) banana is the proof of God's plan.  It only takes a minute to look up Polystrate Trees on wikipedia to find plenty of scientific explaination of the phenomonon.  I wonder how creationists wiggle around the reminants of limbs in whale skeletons. newlinechar  newlinechar It is unfortunate that you added the line about no belief in God.  The idea that one either thinks the Earth is 4000 years old or they are atheist is a false dichotomy.  The overwhelming majority of Americans and the world believe in both a God and evolution, so you do the math.  However, if you assume evolutionists are all godless then why bother quoting the Bible in the first place? newlinechar  newlinechar It is quite obvious that many parts of the Bible, and in particular Genesis, are intended to be allogories.  Genesis is filled with logical contradictions - God creates man in Chapter 1 and then creates him again in Chapter 2; Cain is protected from other people even though there shouldn't be any other people to worry about; Noah's boat is no where close to large enough to fufill the role is described.  Until I meet someone who thinks sacrificing a dove is the best way to get rid of mildew or that one can't sit in the same seat that a girl on her period sat on - - until I meet that person I won't believe anyone takes the Bible litterally.  Plucked out your eye lately? newlinechar  newlinechar What impresses me is that both science and Genesis actually match up quite well.  Both place the origin of civilized man between the Tigris and Euphrates.  Both say that the Earth was created first, then came plants, fish and insects, followed by land animals, and finally mankind.  Even the anchient Hebrews were smart enough to observe that fish obviously came before mammals. newlinechar  newlinechar Jesus never talked about the Earth being laughably young, but he did spend an awful amount of time talking about not judging others and pointing out the hypocracy of religious leaders.  Meanwhile, too many Christians spend their time telling other groups they are hellbound and blindly following their neo-con masters as they lead this country into social and economic ruin.
Well this particular group was founded as a Hamas front group and they are notorious for their links to terrorism.

More people turn out for Christmas, though most understand that Easter is more important. newlinechar  newlinechar Christmas?

Bright's implementation *is* the sole specification for the language as of 1.0: there is no substitute or alternative.

I was following Reddit's own [suggestion](http://reddit.com/help/reddiquette): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;[Don't] conduct polls using posts. If you feel you must use Reddit to conduct a poll do it using a comment. Create a self referencing post and then add a comment for readers to mod up or down based on their answer to your poll question. Also, be sure to indicate in the title of your post that the polls is being conducted using comments. Including something like '(use comments to vote)' in the title would probably be sufficient.

The real problem with the DMCA is that people don't know how to file a counter-notification. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If someone issues a DMCA take-down notice, a US-based ISP is legally required to take down the content.

I don't think it's that simple, but I agree with your sentiment. The dynamics in this industry are very complicated, and finding a solution won't be easy. But it's high time we recognize that the current regime is not producing results. The rules have to be changed. The pharmas will probably remain profit driven, but I could see radical changes occurring elsewhere in insurance, managers, etc. The incentive structure needs change. Perhaps the first step is giving users real bargaining power, because currently, if you're lucky enough to be included in the system (you have a job and are not sick), you still don't have any power.

I don't think there's much argument about the readability here.

I really believe we need shorter term limits, for all positions in the House and the Sentate.  The career politician needs to know that if he or she is doing a bad job that they won't be able to delay a change in their behavior because they won't be voted out in years, but that they face expulsion within mere months.

Your point is correct.  Posting things like this to a forum of like-minded people *will* actively spread the hate.  I have nothing against that as a tactic, because it demonstrably works.  If anything, I advocate doing that *instead* of emailing the company, because companies don't really get the full picture from direct customer contact.  They get it from market trends.

&gt; If 100,000,000 want to establish a Caliphate and slaughter infidels, you might want to take them seriously. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, you can turn on your TV right now to see people in the US who want to 'turn the middle east into a parking lot' and deport all non-residents.

To me it's like the Japanese word 'Gajin'. In a text book it'll likely say 'foreigner' but in reality it means 'foreign devil' or 'barbarian'. I have always assumed infidels was pretty much the same thing and had an undercurrent of insult behind it.

I've been using it in production for a few weeks in a University department for internal IT support and software development. newlinechar  newlinechar So far I have found it to be very good and fast. I've found a couple of rough edges, but nothing major. A couple of things that it has going for it over trac are multiple project support, and built-in support for multiple repository sites (i.e. no need for plugins if you use something other than Subversion). newlinechar  newlinechar I've found it nice and feature-full and easily and extensively configurable. Also, my non-technical users have found it very easy to use to raise issues and the like. newlinechar  newlinechar To sum up, the major features that I like: newlinechar  newlinechar * Many useful modules: Issue tracking, repository browser, wiki, forums, document and file storage. newlinechar * Multiple projects in the one instance newlinechar * Ability to turn on and off modules and issue types on a per-project basis newlinechar * Configurable workflows and permissions newlinechar * Editiable issue types. newlinechar * Easy-to-use web based configuration.

Since they were making it available as a free download, it is a noncommercial distribution. I think they're covered. newlinechar  newlinechar It's an edge case, but from what I saw the supposed Ubuntu developer didn't really do his homework and may have opened himself up for doing a false claim under the DMCA. newlinechar  newlinechar And even if the GPL was violated (which has not been demonstrated) you are supposed to be a copyright holder to file a takedown notice.

No.  Look up the reelection rates of incumbents.

Someone with as much power as a President isn't likely to do that. newlinechar  newlinechar The 'tide of congress changing' is usually just a few seats, out of hundreds, switching from one party to another.  We're usually close to a 50/50 split, so it doesn't take much. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm actually pretty astounded someone would try to imply that reelection rates for incumbents are anything but extraordinary.

&gt;The LAW is the LAW that existed before time began. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That's not helpful when talking to an atheist.  It assumes a central authority that has not been proven, only asserted.  Truth by assertion is automatically questioned.  If we can't test it, then we won't accept it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;As to whether God would strive to clarify the changes, I think he did. In every word that comes out of Jesus' mouth in the text that remains to us. No one who reads what he 'alledgely' said can deny the wisdom of it. Faked? Shopped? We as a race reset our calender on this man. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, that didn't happen until *long* after his alleged birth, and that by fiat by religious officials.  There's a reason it's referred to as the Gregorian calendar, and another why not every culture on earth follows it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar However, Jesus' words did nothing to clarify which laws are still in effect, and which have been laid aside.  In fact, there are no clarifications on homosexuality, shellfish or disobedient children at all.  Your reference in Acts comes *after* his alleged return to Heaven. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Is there wisdom in the Bible?  Sure, just as there's wisdom in the Koran, and the teachings of the Buddha and just about every other religion on Earth.  Most religions include guidelines on practical social controls so everybody learns to get along.  It's the supernatural claims that atheists reject, because they can only ever be taken on faith without any proof beyond what's written in your preferred holy text. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Most of the wisdom to be found in these texts has be considered in terms of the society it was originally written for.  Relevance changes as society changes.  Atheists are fond of discussing the barter and treatment of slaves (i.e. I have two daughters that would bring me a very nice profit were I to sell them into slavery as Biblical law allows), but that's no longer appropriate today.  Homosexuality is another favorite, because modern medicine and hygiene means that the old reasons for prohibiting it are no longer valid.  Each and every value asserted by the Bible has to come under scrutiny rather than accepted blindly, but most religious believers are content to simply let their leaders tell them what's appropriate and what isn't.  That's why we have Pope Benedict XVI, Pat Robertson and Fred Phelps all trying to decide for their flock and condemning anyone who disagrees. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Do I have to consider the hypothesis?  Absolutely.  Just because people have used the wrong methods to arrive at a conclusion doesn't invalidate it, it simply means we need to find an alternate way to explore their conclusions.  The problem is that none of the data we've come up with fit those conclusions, so more and more we're having to reject those claims.  This is why I believe science can never reconcile with religion, because religion's purpose is to fill in the gaps where science hasn't yet come up with an answer.  As science answers more questions, religion has fewer gaps to fill and loses more of its power.  Thus we have the remarkable backlash by the religious communities that we're observing today, hoping to discredit science and restore the rule of religion over our lives. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar For my part, I will fight against that backlash and remind people of the need for critical thinking.
I think what he is saying is that creationist don't reject data entirely.  They do form it to fit their pre-conceived beliefs as they process data, but don't reject it outright (you'd end up being completely blind, deaf, and hard of smelling). newlinechar  newlinechar I think that's what the 911 truthers do, to some extent, but it's not their fault.  We do have scientific consensus that evolution is true.  We really don't have any kind of consensus on 911 because everyone aboard every plane is dead, some evidence was destroyed, and the private efforts are so far incomplete. Only the federal government has both the means and the motive to do a comprehensive, conclusive study.  For seem reason, the fed doesn't seem that interested. newlinechar  newlinechar In this kind of environment, all kinds of mis-information is bound to spread.  I'm not even saying the truthers ARE wrong about everything, but it's not their fault.  It is human to try to make patterns out of incomplete data.  The government should be doing a better job of figuring out what really happened, then making decisions based on real, factual, cohesive, information.
Bush is far less complicated than people give him credit for. newlinechar  newlinechar Have you noticed that when Bush talks, you can kind of see Cheney's lips move and can never see his left hand?

&gt;(Does it count as a denial if I am lying?) newlinechar  newlinechar Yes newlinechar 
Based on a lot of evidence, it's pretty clear that our federal government is highly corrupt.  I don't know if they are really that interested in the well-being of Israel, or if they just don't care at all about the well-being of America.

I know if you win in small claims it can result permanent injunctive relief, damages/court costs awarded to you (if you can show actual damages), and possibly some punitive damages awarded to you if the defendant broke the law. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think you need to a lawyer to file a small claims suit.

That reminds me of a time last summer when I went to parallel park.  There are no cars around me at the time, so I signal a right turn, and put my truck into reverse.  During this time the red light behind me changed to green and one Cavalier comes right up to my bumper.  I wave him around me thinking that he just didn't realise that I was trying to park.  He sits there for a few minutes, then drives around me while his girlfriend shouts 'Fucker!!' out the passenger window. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Classy.  I also threatened to back up into him a few times after he didn't move.  I also thought about letting my truck stall and getting out and telling him what that means, and what section of the SGI drivers handbook it's in.

Yes, dbus is one pick. The other one is bonobo, it seems. That's probably one too many, and you can also encounter apps where scripting is done through Python or Java interface. newlinechar  newlinechar OTOH, you are a bit mistaken about COM. When scripting using it, you are normally out of process (you can, of course, be in, too), and a binary interface is not required (think IDispatch). Maybe I should have said 'automation', as that's the *subset* of COM that's used for scripting.
&gt; Yes. It happens all the time. Right this very minute there are tens of thousands of intelligence agents and soldiers who are privy to all kinds of secret information that have not revealed it. newlinechar  newlinechar Keeping some kinds of secrets is a different beast altogether than keeping other secrets. newlinechar  newlinechar 'I was involved in a covert op to overthrow a foreign government' is not a secret that is nearly as provocative or guilt inducing as 'I ran a false flag op that killed 3000 of my own people and lead to two wars that lead to the deaths of thousands more.' Even if the former secret gets out, it's not horribly scandalous; we know it happens, whether for good or ill, and a significant (if misguided) segment of the population either outright advocates such behavior or tacitly approves of such. newlinechar  newlinechar The same can not be said for the latter; keeping a secret of that magnitude, beyond a very small handful of people, would be virtually impossible. One man, somewhere, will have an inducement to talk. Of the hundreds (possibly thousands) of people involved in a supposed 9-11 inside job, it's virtually unthinkable that every single last one of them is still on good terms with the Bush Administration or other shadowy quasigovernment; someone of the lot has been burned by a superior, disagrees with recent policy, has a financial problem that would compromise him, has grown a conscience and is willing to risk his life to expose the plot, is compromised and/or affiliated with a foreign intel agency, or fuck knows what else. You simply _can't_ keep a secret of that magnitude with a significantly large universe of people. Every person added to the plot increases the chances of it being blown by orders of magnitude, with the explosiveness of the secret adding yet another order of magnitude. newlinechar  newlinechar But you've had the kool-aid.

No, let's walk through this again. Given the circumstances, a copyright claim would be the most likely venue for getting relief in the courts and action from offending parties, yes, I am not disputing that. newlinechar  newlinechar What I am arguing is that, if you get down to brass tacks, the kind of issue you have with your cyber-doppelganger is actually exactly the kind of issue businesses have when other businesses misappropriate their trademarks. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's go through this in detail.  newlinechar  newlinechar You make some money by putting your writing and photography on the internet and running ads next to it. The guy who has been causing you problems has, according to your summary, done two distinct things: newlinechar (a) first, he has infringed your various copyrights and put up a wholesale duplicate of your website newlinechar (b) in addition, he has done such a tremendous job promoting 'his' website that, for example, it was showing up above yours in search results, with the consequence that a casual searcher might very well think *you* were the doppelganger, not that other guy. newlinechar  newlinechar Given the nature of your business, it's clearly (b) that all your real damages were flowing from, not (a); if this guy had made a complete mirror of your website that was impossible to find accidentally -- ie, that did not appear within the first several hundred google results obtained when searching on terms for which your website appears in the early results -- you would still be nominally 'wronged' by its existence, but very little. newlinechar  newlinechar A very clean analogy would be to a situation like this: a legitimate broadcast network broadcasts on channel 11; a pirate broadcaster has setup a device that immediately rebroadcasts the signal from channel 11 on channel 12 (not in use by any legit channels at the moment), with the exception that channel 11's ads are stripped out and instead channel 12 inserts its own paid advertisements, and similarly all station identifiers for channel 11 are stripped out and replaced with identifiers for channel 12. (this actually happens in the 3rd world!) The harm to channel 11 isn't coming directly from the signal-reception -&gt;rebroadcast, it's coming from lost advertising revenue  newlinechar  newlinechar In both your case and the case of our hypothetical channel 11 the most immediate remedy is to cut off the offending party's ability to infringe the materials, and if either you or them came to me for advice that's the advice I'd give.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, the specific nature of the harm you're suffering is sufficiently different from the standard harm victims of copyright infringement claim to suffer -- you are suffering loss of traffic and therefore advertising revenue, the typical victim is suffering loss of potential sales because potential customers can obtain the victim's works through other, more dubious sources -- that it doesn't seem at all similar, other than that in both cases copyrights are being ignored by the offending parties.  newlinechar  newlinechar The actual nature of the harm you suffered is, as stated above, much more along the lines of that suffered when trademarks are misappropriated, or along the lines of your identity being stolen, it just happens in this case that the act of misappropriation of ('trademark' or identity) involves heavy copyright infringement to perform, and thus attacking the infringement is the easy way to stop the problem from continuing. newlinechar  newlinechar I've gone into this point because your case brings up a somewhat philosophical nit I've been looking to pick for awhile: intellectual property, as such, is entirely created by statute and, consequently, the legal definitions of the various kinds of intellectual property are fairly detailed.  newlinechar  newlinechar However, just because the definitions are detailed doesn't mean that they actually are all that natural (in the same way that saying 'nonzero positive integers are either 1, multiples of 2, multiples of 3, or what ever is left over' is a detailed-ish description, but not necessarily *natural*).  newlinechar  newlinechar In your case, a lot of copyright infringement was necessary for you to be harmed, but I still contend the real harm is more along what trademark is supposed to protect (namely, it's supposed to protect your business venture from 'identity theft' like you suffered from). However, there's a good chance that you wouldn't be able to win a suit on pure trademark grounds, unless you lucked out and had a logo, etc. (look-and-feel cases are near-impossible). newlinechar  newlinechar This strikes me as an example of a big gap in our current set of intellectual property laws -- there's nothing in there that captures stuff that's not-really misappropriation of trademark, etc., but is still identity theft of some sort, including straight-up identity theft (which can be prosecuted as fraud, but still belongs to this category).  newlinechar  newlinechar For most concrete violations there's usually other things that can be used to seek redress (copyright violations, fraud claims, etc.), but I worry that some of those laws may be bent out of shape (or, as some other parts of the DMCA, have already been bent out of shape) to cover over the gap in the current spectrum of intellectual property laws (namely, the real gap of direct remedies for impersonation).  newlinechar  newlinechar So we're straight, I have no sympathy for your impersonator and am glad you were able to get your issue solved as quickly as you were; I am just using your story to bring up one of my concerns about the current regime (basically, certain fundamental 'intellectual crimes' have no direct codification in our intellectual property laws but are redressable via other aspects of the law, with the risk that those other branches will then run risk of distortion if they're doing double duty as the only remedy for the uncodified crimes, like impersonation).

&gt;What is your proposed solution to this? newlinechar  newlinechar I am not sure I have one. What I had to say was an observation, not just a piece of rhetoric for a sociopolitical agenda.  newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps the closest I could come to a proposed solution is simply a change in attitude. The first sentence I quoted pretty much tells the story. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;&gt; ...stereotype that you have to spend a ton of money to win over a woman newlinechar  newlinechar The built-in assumption is that it is a man's responsibility to 'win over' the woman.  newlinechar  newlinechar But this is only true because everyone believes it. There are no market conditions here. There is no scarcity. Men and women are present in our society in equal portions.  newlinechar  newlinechar Women have attained equal (or indeed greater) power in many aspects of life in our culture. But they have not yielded up their position as sole sexual gatekeepers.  newlinechar  newlinechar I admit I do not know precisely how this last can be made to happen. But I know that until it does happen, men will be unhappy with the status quo, resentful, inclined to post articles like this one, and to respond with a feeling of [white-hot rage](http://reddit.com/info/623wh/comments/c02lf9k) when confronting feminism. newlinechar  newlinechar This is the natural behaviour, you see, of people who perceive that they have been treated unfairly.

It sounds somewhat similar to what Mercurial does. newlinechar  newlinechar In Mercurial, first of all, history is immutable; while you can undo your latest commit using the rollback command, all of the earlier changesets are essentially there to stay forever. newlinechar  newlinechar Second of all, Mercurial changesets have an ID that depends on the content of the patches, the username, the date and time, the commit message, *and* the changeset's parent(s). This means that in order to apply a changeset to your tree, you must have all of the history that changeset depends on by way of its ID, which provides for pretty strong integrity (and it makes clean cherrypicking impossible; in Mercurial, a changeset needs to change its ID to be cherrypicked). newlinechar  newlinechar Merging is always explicit. If you pull in two changesets that are not each others parent or child, you will have to merge from their common base to an explicit merge revision (these are always revisions with two parents). To keep the complexity of merges under control, you cannot do merges of more than two branches (diverging changeset series); instead, you have to merge them two at a time. newlinechar  newlinechar To me, this sounds pretty similar to the kinds of things you describe here. newlinechar  newlinechar An example: the development of Mercurial itself mostly revolves around 4 branches, all in different locations. One, the 'main' branch, is the branch by the founding developer. This is basically similar to Subversion's trunk: the central development repository. In addition to this branch, he maintains a stable branch. This is similar to a release branch in Subversion in that it contains all the fixes to a release, but no new features. Bugfixes are always made on a stable branch and then merged back to the development branch. There is then a 'stream' of changesets that just make bugfixes, and this stream gets weaved together with another stream of new features/more complicated fixes, which moves toward a new release. newlinechar  newlinechar To remove the bottleneck of the single developer, there's a select group of about 8 developers who have push privileges to a 'crew' branch. This is on an entirely different server; these developers push their changes there, after which the main developer (and anyone else tracking development) pulls them into his development tree (these trees are similar most of the time, except that the main tree usually lags a bit). Then there's a crew-stable branch that does the same thing for crew as the stable branch for main; it's usually just pulled into stable. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to hear more, drop into #mercurial on freenode and ask around. From what you've described here, Mercurial seems like a pretty good fit.

Come on. Think about this for a sec people. Osama Bin Laden was a *former* CIA ally. He went on camera telling everybody it was Al Quaeda, except we now know it was Saudis (which Bin Laden was) on the plane. Then the U.S. military can't find Bin Laden- couldn't possibly be the CIA hiding him, like when they took a couple dozen of his family members back into the U.S. right after 9/11 for safety precautions. newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, does this not add up. Is it really that difficult to believe the CIA doing something evil and nefarious. **THAT'S ALL THE CIA DOES**.  newlinechar  newlinechar The Bush administration may not (and probably) wasn't in on it, but the neo-con machine wanted a war in Iraq and so they were going to get one. Bush was just another pawn in getting there.  newlinechar  newlinechar Cheney definitely knew more about what was going on, but I still doubt he knew what the CIA was up to. He's just glad a reason for a war was started and the military-industrial complex then used him to influence Bush in support of a war.  newlinechar  newlinechar The attack on 9/11 had CIA backing. It was done too smoothly (3 successful hijacked plans on 1 day). They weren't shot down and the towers fell way too quick. Even if you don't believe all that is enough to point to the CIA, you definitely have to concede that they're still on the table as a possibility.

I've got alot of gripes with JIRA. newlinechar  newlinechar If you've used it for awhile - particularly if you've had to support / customize the actual JIRA install, you'll quickly find yourself browsing through Atlassian's own (slow-ass) JIRA and finding that all the gripes and bugs you're discovering are mentioned, duped several times over the course of some years, and collecting dust. Atlassian doesn't appear able to use their own system effectively - that or they are seriously under-resourced. Their updates reflect the typical track of a mature and over-complicated Java app - spending so much time managing the ugly regressions and infrastructure problems in the beast that they've built that it becomes impossible to push through anything genuinely new or useful, or make the fundamental improvements which their customers request again and again.  newlinechar  newlinechar For a bug tracking system that goes for (and prices for) the 'enterprise' space, JIRA comes up incredibly short on everything you'd expect. It's 'time tracking' is appallingly crude and lame. It's lauded workflow processes are unnecessarily painful to administer and change. It's abilities to send updates via email etc aren't near as flexible and granular as they should be. It's web services API is anemic and hasn't been significantly beefed up since its initial implementation. The database schema has been designed by noobs. LDAP/AD integration is a hack and still requires setting up accounts for everyone in JIRA. 'Integration' with their wiki product Confluence, despite the fact that they sell this pairing hard, is pretty much non-existent, and you only need to look at public docs on said integration to realize just how shabby it really is.  newlinechar  newlinechar Trac is great, but won't cut it for our needs.

The Bush Administration has been punishing Iran with economic sanctions getting the rest of the world to join in. Now we know that the administration knew Iran had stopped their weapons program back in 2003. I believe Bush and company were punishing Iran to get them pissed off enough to restart their program in order to give a reason for a war with Iran. Bush sent many naval vessels to the waters off the coast of Iran to conduct war games also in an attempt to lure them into doing something provocative. Bush and his people have been trying to get the American people to believe we need to attack Iran or risk a nuclear bomb from them. Now we know that the Bush Administration was lying and trying to start another war.

&gt;Iran is a signatory state of the NPT and has recently (as of 2006) resumed development of a uranium enrichment program. The Iranian government asserts that this enrichment program is part of its civilian nuclear energy program, which is permitted under Article IV of the NPT. However, Iran violated its NPT safeguards agreement by pursuing uranium enrichment in secret, after which the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution ordering Iran to suspend its enrichment-related activity.[25] The United States and some members of the European Union have accused Iran of using this program to help covertly develop nuclear weapons, which would be in violation of article II of the NPT. Iran remains under investigation by the International Atomic Energy Agency. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In November 2003 IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei reported that Iran had repeatedly and over an extended period failed to meet with its safeguards obligations, including by failing to declare its uranium enrichment program.[26] After nearly two years of diplomatic efforts led by France, Germany and the UK, in September 2005, the IAEA Board of Governors, acting under Article XII.C of the IAEA Statute, found that these failures constituted non-compliance with the IAEA safeguards agreement, not the NPT itself.[27] The United States contends on this basis that Iran violated Article II as well as Article III of the NPT.[28] However, the December 2007 National Intelligence Estimate judged, with 'high confidence,” that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003, with 'moderate confidence' that the program remained frozen, and with 'moderate-to-high confidence' that Iran 'is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons.'[29] newlinechar  newlinechar

How is that a sugar coated translation? newlinechar  newlinechar For example, every translation of Luke 12:47 shows Jesus as making a simple observation- where is one translation that shows that as a command? newlinechar  newlinechar Just to give your interpretation the benefit of the doubt, I assumed that all of the translations I checked are sugar-coated, so I went and made my own translation of the verse. The verb for 'beaten' is in the indicative mood. In Greek, a command or recommendation is given in the imperative mood 99% of the time, and in the Bible the indicative is used  in an imperative sense only when quoting the LXX, which this is not. But in any case, the mood is irrelavent. The voice of the verb is passive, not active, meaning that it applies to the person being beaten, not to the person doing the beating. So, if Jesus is making a command (which is *very* unlikely linguistically), it is a command to the slaves (to beat themselves I guess), not to the masters. So, if you are going to use linguistic criticism (and not just 'sugar-coated translations'), then your interpretation of this verse does not hold up. And it also does not hold up under literaty criticism: this is a parable. It is not about a master beating his slave- that is just an observation of the world made to get at another point. newlinechar  newlinechar If you are going to take a shot at the Bible, fine. But like I said, make it a good one- there are definitely enough of them out there. Don't just take a verse, read it wrongly and out of context, and them blame arguments to your interpretation on 'sugar-coated translations.'

Fortran 80??  I know F77 (fixed form), F90 and F95 (both free form), but not F80.  That said however, the use of whitespace is completely different in F77 and python. newlinechar  newlinechar (In F77 and earlier versions, col 1-5 were used for line numbers, col 6 for 'continuation characters' (for wrapping lines) and col 7-72 for program text. The parser is whitespace ignorant, `e n d i f`, `end if` and `endif` are all the same (as well as `e ndif`).  Blocks are commonly written without indentation)

It doesn't matter if they're lockstep (though they act like it on the forums). What does matter, is that we allow room for dissenters inside and out. That won't happen, if both parties were hijacked. The republicans allow some modest dissent if you're part of the good ole boys network, if you pay your dues and phrase everything in their version of political correctness. In other words, it's no dissent at all. newlinechar  newlinechar It can't and shouldn't be like that anymore. Let's not become what the old parties were. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; A bunch of us are even hoping Kucinich will be his running mate. newlinechar  newlinechar Me too, and when I posted that to the forums, they started howling.

Oh ya wouldn't doubt it.  I have many friends who see my Ron Paul t-shirt and say 'Who's that' or 'whats this Ron Paul thing?'  Gotta educate them, but once you introduce them to the man and the message they go on an internet frenzy searching him and they hop right on board.  Thats the problem with the older generation, even if you tell them who Ron Paul is and what he stands for, most of them don't know how to use a computer to look him up and find more information about him.  So the information quickly leaves their brain when they go back to the MSM and hear about how great Giuliani, Romney, and Huckabee are.

Here is what you need to figure out, between the time of Jesus' Ascension and the emergence of the Bible, what was it that held the Church together?  The Holy Spirit is the best answer, but what does this mean in visible practice? The Bible came after the Church. The Bible only exists because of the Church.  You go into irrational territory when you claim that it took 1500 years for the rabbid anti-Semite Martin Luther to realize that the Bible was wrong and that Jesus didn't found a Church but intended to leave behind a document with which a German monk could found a new sect...

I didn't get the impression that he thought it was necessarily a bad song, just that the song created a popular impression of the band that wasn't really accurate. newlinechar  newlinechar The theory is certainly sound. Many artists have achieved fame with a hit that doesn't represent their catalog. They're left with the choice of changing who they are to appease the public or disappointing new fans and fading back into obscurity. newlinechar  newlinechar However I think he's really overstating the problem. The song's not *that* atypical. I doubt many people who got turned on to the band with Stairway were disappointed by the rest of their catalog. It doesn't seem to me that they changed their sound significantly to appease new fans. And most importantly, they went on for nine more years and released two more albums. So that's hardly being ruined.
I think this argument is based on the same general principle as the argument that switching from Windows to OS X will prevent you from getting viruses. If all the identity thieves are focusing on using SSNs, and it's really convenient to register for accounts with SSNs, then giving out your SSN makes you an easier target. newlinechar  newlinechar In a sense, the article proves its own point about SSNs. If identity thieves have to call 8 people at Verizon and send photocopies of your driver's license and company ID in order to set up a fake account, they'll give up and use someone else's SSN. newlinechar  newlinechar In other words, the hurdles you have to jump are the same as the ones the thieves have to jump. They'll choose the easier target in almost every case.

Tony has one of the most obnoxious, and inane, ways of arguing I've ever come across. The first time I saw him make the argument that pure functional programming is the only correct way to program computers because reality is fundamentally immutable (as space-time in the theory of relativity is a static object rather than a dynamic process) I thought he was making an elaborate joke; turns out he was dead serious.  newlinechar  newlinechar What makes this experience singular is that I agree with many of his conclusions, but his reasons are so utterly opposed in both outline and detail to my own (which are grounded in empirical benefits, though these often have a theoretical backing); it is religion in almost the literal sense of the term.
well, most americans aren't aware of any of the f'd up shit the CIA does around the world.  just ask them if we should invade iran and you'll get fervor.  then ask them who the shaw was and you get blank stares. newlinechar  newlinechar so i don't think it's too unexpected that when those otherwise uninformed people hear (for the first time) that we armed and backed bin laden, that they begin to imagine what other deceptions are out there.  and i do think it's a deception.  look at the stunned look on this pinhead interviewer in the clip.  and this wasn't even covert... american papers had congressmen(nay presidential candidates) shaking hands with bin laden. newlinechar  newlinechar i mean there is zero public conversation, on any mainstream media source, about whether it as a net good to back bin laden in afghanistan.  shit, there's no discussion about whether the cold war was worth while. newlinechar  newlinechar so my point is that when people wake up to these discrepancies, they begin to wonder what else they haven't been told. newlinechar

I am far more concerned with starving children than a tree.  My point is, however, that if we don't take significant steps to protect the environment, there will not -be- a world for human children to not starve in.  Obviously reforestation is only a facet of this and altering governmental policies is much more important.  This doesn't have anything to do with Al Gore.  Global climate shift is not only happening because he happens to be talking about it. newlinechar  newlinechar That's why I don't want to support Christian charities, actually.  Like you, they seem to think that what will happen in a few centuries is immaterial, and we have to directly help individuals now.  I happen to rather strongly feel that there's not going to be an Armageddon to make what we're doing to this planet irrelevant, and I would like to see humanity not threatened by the world itself. newlinechar  newlinechar I also horribly dislike the belief in the nonexistent that Christian charities generally work to instill in the people they're helping.  Too much of the world already has Faith that their problems will be solved because some cosmic force cares about them.  If you don't think you've got God to catch you, you've got to work to save yourself.  That is in my estimation a good thing.

There are a couple problems.  Here is the largest.  He is maintaining a hash in an array and resizing for every add or remove and with a very inefficient method of locating information. newlinechar  newlinechar A hash is a way of storing information to be referenced via some type of key.  For example, we might have a hash storing user objects for reddit users.  We could look your's up in the hash with the string 'aletoledo'.  This would return your object and we could do whatever we wanted. newlinechar  newlinechar A good hash stores the keys in a manner that allows rapid searching.  His implementation loops through all the keys until it finds what he wants.  How much longer would it take you to find a word in the dictionary, if they were put in there in no order?  You couldn't open it up and see 'f'.  I'm looking for cat, so let me go back to 'b'.  Too far, 'c'.  OK, now second letter...  The same thing happens here.  Much time wasted if you have to look at each word in a row to find what you want.  (This similarity is another reason why you might see a hash called a dictionary in certain languages.) newlinechar  newlinechar Next, a good hash stores data in such a way that adding and removing is fairly efficient.    This is done with advanced data structures based in linking to data.  You can look up linked lists to start and go from there to get an understanding of this.  The bottom line is that adding and removing should be fairly fast and other than sorting the key into the hash, independent of the size of the hash.  His implementation will keep getting slower with data added, because C# has to make an entire copy of the array when it resizes to add or remove and item.

I guess the difference between our viewpoints here is that I had been examining this issue in the context of running a distributed Erlang app across the instances. In this case you have already built your app to be resilient in the face of component failure, you are using mnesia to keep distributed state, and you are using a supervision tree that can deal with node failures. newlinechar  newlinechar If your non-Erlang app has been designed with a shared-nothing/stateless approach then you can gain similar benefits.  Systems boot up, copy what they need from S3 to local disk, run (with occasional checkpoints back to S3 for persistence), and when you no longer need the capacity you kill the instance. newlinechar  newlinechar

Your comment is re*volt*ing.
You are correct that it is also very academically popular. But this has less to do with features and more with the vocal advocation of some of them. Academics really like platform neutrality. A lot of tools are platform neutral, but are not that 'gospel' about it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Java advertised with features that appeal to  academics. Yet it actual popularity in the market place has everything to do with Java being manager-friendly. newlinechar  newlinechar One of the advantages of Java is that you can develop a program with programmers with a different level of skill, for example. newlinechar  newlinechar The experienced developper will design the architecture, including the interfaces for all required classes. The less experienced programmers just have to create implementations of those interfaces. newlinechar  newlinechar So the work is divided into small bite-size snacks, with one or few good programmers leading the overal design.  newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, maintainability. Say we want to add some feature to some class. We need not rewrite the whole app because it had a sane design. But the class that we need to change is complete mess, because it was written by somebody inexperienced (ie. somebody _cheap_). We just rewrite that little class now that it is going to play a bigger role in the overal app.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is the reason Java works well for a large part of corporate world.  newlinechar  newlinechar Not because it's a very good hammer. But it is a very _manageable_ hammer. As hammers come and go, it is likely the most sucky one still used today.

You have to remember that those immigrants have children.  They also tend to have children at much greater rates than natives.   You might find this interesting: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Immigration is clearly an important source of population growth in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, net international migration acounts for between 40 and 45 percent of annual growth in recent years. Researchers calculating the contribution of immigrants and their children to U.S. population growth over the past 30 years or so concluded that these 1st and 2nd generation residents accounted for about 55 percent of growth. Several papers from the Pew Hispanic Center discuss the assumptions behind these estimates. newlinechar  newlinechar http://discuss.prb.org/content/interview/detail/1172/ newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Certainly birth rate is a factor, but we need to start looking at solutions to having unsustainable growth.

&gt;Arent you going to have to heavily regulate the advertising industry(which we already do) for this to work? newlinechar  newlinechar The answer is NO. Apply what I just wrote to advertisers. If one company writes false advertising, the other company can include this in their marketing. 'Look, these people are lying!' newlinechar  newlinechar The end result is that the lying company's business is DESTROYED. Now, sure, they can ATTEMPT to lie, but if they ever attempt to do such a thing, their entire business will be wiped out because no one will want to deal with such liars. Why would any company do this? They won't! Not if they have any intention to stay in business for more than one day! newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This whole plan is based on advertising. newlinechar  newlinechar Not true. I didn't mention the other things because advertising is a much easier point to make. The other things this 'plan' (it really is no plan) is based on are consumer groups. Organizations that review products. Consumer Reports. And if THEY cannot be trusted, their business, too, will be destroyed (just look at the recent Gamespot fiasco, if you in any way follow the video game industry -- this company has forever destroyed their brand because of that one mistake). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Your plan requires extremely informed consumers. newlinechar  newlinechar No it most certainly does not. The plan requires companies to pay attention to what their competitors are doing -- which they already do, since they want to make *money*. This happens today, it happens all the time, and you seem to be blind to it.

Well, I think mediocre things may rule in the short term because of fashion or other network effects, but never in the long term. newlinechar  newlinechar Country music is more popular than Bach today.

Java is more popular than Lisp today, but Lisp has existed since the 1950s and it will persist once Java is gone.  Windows is more popular than Unix today, but Unix has existed since the 1960s and it will persist (in some form) once Windows is gone. newlinechar  newlinechar Bach, Lisp, and Unix have had a greater influence on their respective fields than country music, Java, or Windows.  If you measure popularity by how widely something is imitated, you could say they've already won. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think there is any inherent advantage to being mediocre.  It's just that what people are using *now* is always subject to random fluctuations.

&gt;I don't see how you can even think such a thing.  newlinechar  newlinechar They are orthogonal. You can have a nation with corporate entities practically running the country themselves with no government interference. You can have one with companies kept at arms length from government, and little regulation. You can have one with a regulated market, and no corporations at all. Or you can have a regulated market, with strong  corporate influence on government. newlinechar  newlinechar Two separate issues. In fact, the very existence of corporate entities is government intervention in the economy. Individuals should be held civilly, criminally, as well as financially responsible for how their investment dollars are used. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Wrong again. Companies are pushed to create things that people will want to buy in successively greater numbers. Other companies, meanwhile, are pushed to compete with them. The driving force here is efficiency, and consumers have direct benefit because they can buy more for less. newlinechar  newlinechar Are people in 1st world democratic nations suffering from a lack of consumer buying power or product choice? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Companies benefit first by being free to seek profit in any way they want. newlinechar  newlinechar Which is the agenda behind this extremist economic position. Free to exploit workers however you please. Free to trash the environment. Free to foist harmful products on society with no regard to the long term effects.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The people benefit second by being offered a larger choice of products/services, at higher and higher quality and lower and lower prices through the forces of competition and natural selection.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is a typical talking point; but it doesn't match the reality of environments where there are few controls on the market, the disparity between rich and poor widens and you get a rich elite class and a poor underclass, for whom all that supposed economic freedom means very little. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Quality of life is not always related to freedom. You've never read any science fiction books? newlinechar  newlinechar Those same nations at the top of the HDI are also tops in areas of personal liberties and respect for human rights. Norway, England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan etc. aren't 'utopian dictatorships'. A civil society that cares about its members enough that allowing businesses to do what they please without regard to long-term consequences or the well-being of the population as a whole isn't acceptable economic policy, is one that shows demonstrable benefits according to objective criteria. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Ask yourself: Would you rather be free and poor, or rich and repressed? newlinechar  newlinechar False dilemma. The most rational course is to examine what works *in practice*, and implement those policies with ongoing examination of their effects; not blind adherence to an absolutist and extremist ideology.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'd rather have strong civil liberties and a government kept in check by the people, and a market where anyone with talent and ambition can excel, yet all people have their basic health, education, and shelter needs met: where those who fall on hard times are not reduced to starvation, but are instead given the help they need to become independent again. newlinechar  newlinechar A democratic nation, with its attendant legal and economic systems, exists for the benefit of all its citizens, not an elite few, be they nobility, bankers, or priesthood.  A nation with no opportunity for the (poor) majority of the population to have a say in economic policy is one that tends toward  oligarchy, in practice despite any official egalitarian label you put on it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There have, in fact, been many studies that conclude that libertarian theories would produce the most optimal results. Libertarianism does not exist in a vacuum. It is a thoroughly-researched topic. newlinechar  newlinechar Studies from right-wing thinktanks. How is this any different from Marxist-Leninists putting forward their own social-economic theories a century ago and insisting they had the One True Way? This is *theory*, wishful thinking, and ideological driven propaganda. For all practical purposes, it's a religious viewpoint, supported by faith, not objectivity or empiricism. newlinechar  newlinechar Did you read this? newlinechar http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?ref=world newlinechar  newlinechar

Scarborough hasn't been afraid to criticize as far back as I can remember.

Quick explanation of what he's talking about, for the non-Cocoa programmers among us: newlinechar  newlinechar ---- newlinechar  newlinechar Autorelease pools are a sort of faux GC for apps that manage memory manually, using retain counts. (They date back to before Obj-C had GC, but you can still use them today, if you want to or don't want to risk breaking your app with the paradigm switch.) newlinechar  newlinechar If you didn't have autorelease or GC, you would create an object, then release it later, and anything that wants to hold on it will itself retain it, then release it later. This is one step up from malloc/free. newlinechar  newlinechar With autorelease, instead of releasing it, you can *autorelease* the object by adding it to the topmost autorelease pool (which is really easy: just send it the `autorelease` message, instead of the `release` message). newlinechar  newlinechar Every thread has one stack of pools, with no pools by default. When you create a pool, it's automatically pushed onto the stack. When you release the pool, it's automatically popped off the stack. (For obvious reasons, you can't autorelease an autorelease pool. But you can retain and release them.) When a pool gets popped, it releases all the objects inside it. (In a Cocoa app, the Application Kit creates one pool for you in the main thread, but you're not limited to that one pool.) newlinechar  newlinechar This works fine until you get into a tight loop (he mentions this in the article). For a large input set, your loop may accumulate enough used and discarded objects (which all pile up in that pool) to run out of real memory. Then you begin paging. This is the “blowing up memory” that the author is referring to. newlinechar  newlinechar There are three solutions. newlinechar  newlinechar The simple solution is simply to add more autorelease pools. For example, when iterating a collection of objects, your loop may create a pool, process no more than 1000 objects, then throw away the pool; the effect is that you process no more than 1000 objects per pool, and none of these objects make it up to your AppKit-provided pool. newlinechar  newlinechar The hard solution is to do no autoreleasing, ever—you do strict create/release programming, as if autorelease didn't exist. This is not always even possible, because some methods are only available with autorelease (`+[NSURL fileURLWithPath:]`, for example); more to the point, create/release code is harder to read than autorelease code because of the `release` messages sprinkled throughout your code. newlinechar  newlinechar The Leopard-only solution is GC. With GC, all the manual memory management (including `-retain`, `-release`, and `-autorelease`) becomes no-op; the garbage collector takes over completely. Unfortunately, if you already have an app written using autorelease, you would have to do a lot of testing to make sure that GC didn't introduce any memory leaks (more likely) or crashes (less likely). newlinechar

Another option is to run KDE.

Many lawyers get rich representing corporations; many lawyers get rich suing corporations ([such as John Edwards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edwards#Legal_career)).  According to the American Bar Association, there were [over 1,100,000 lawyers practicing in America in 2006 (pdf)](http://www.abanet.org/marketresearch/lawyer_demographics_2006.pdf) and in 2000, 74% worked in private practice (presumably some for corporations), 8% in private industry, and 1% in legal aid/public defense.  Maybe it's just me, but the increase in litigation seems related to the rise of corporate power in this country. newlinechar  newlinechar Edwards has achieved impassioned legal wins for injured people.  However his for-it-before-he-was-against-it record raises questions.  [Edwards voted for the PATRIOT Act and for the Iraq war before he was against both, voted for liberalized trade with China before he was against it (when the lead toys hit the fan), and voted for storing nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain before he was against it](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/30/AR2007113001785.html).  Dennis Kucinich doesn't have this problem--he voted against the PATRIOT Act, voted against the Iraq war, voted against funding the Iraq war, voted against unfair trade agreements.  When Kucinich changes his stance (such as shifting from pro-life to pro-choice), [he explains how he got there](http://www.ontheissues.org/2004/Dennis_Kucinich_Abortion.htm); when Edwards changes his stance, he pretends he's always thought that way and ignores when others call him on it.

I definitely come from a libertarian perspective myself, but my moral foundation is based on natural rights and not economics and pragmatism (although I like economics as well). newlinechar  newlinechar You have a right as an individual to ensure your life and liberty from unscrupulous individuals and organizations. Either you do this retroactively though the courts, or proactively through regulations. newlinechar  newlinechar If the infringement on your rights causes’ death, then you cannot pursue any action in the courts, can you? So you have a right to protect your life proactively from organizations and individuals who would take it. It is not good enough to have to wait for an organization to kill or disfigure you, and then have your distraught family members report them to the Better Business Bureau. newlinechar  newlinechar We know that no matter what consumer protection organizations exist, that some businesses will harm your life. You have a natural right to stop them from doing this proactively through regulation and criminalization; it cannot all be left up to what is most profitable, aka, the market. newlinechar  newlinechar If you leave it up to the market, profit will find equilibrium which includes infringement on natural rights; it will not find equilibrium while excluding all infringement. In your model, killing people thus becomes a cost center to be managed and optimized, not eliminated. As long as the cost of harming someone is less than the revenue gained, then the business will pursue it. The market will not necessarily make the cost of significant infringement greater than the potential revenues.    newlinechar

I suppose just injecting code into the foreground process would work as well, if you have permissions for it.  There's also the obvious exploit of launching a new process whenever you want to gain focus.  (not really sure if these work) newlinechar  newlinechar Having neither access to the Windows' window managers' nor the offending applications' source code, I can't really know for sure how it's implemented.

&gt; Then began the fall of his country because no one was equipped with knowledge on how to sustain their agricultural industries, stability and the economy. This is significantly in part due to the racist apartheid newlinechar  newlinechar People in Zimbabwe are probably the best educated black people in all of Africa. Quote from Wikipedia: newlinechar &gt; Zimbabwe has an adult literacy rate of approximately 90%. This is amongst the highest in Africa. However, since 1995 the adult literacy rate of Zimbabwe has steadily decreased which is a trend shared by other African countries.  newlinechar  newlinechar Zimbabwe’s biggest problem probably came because the people were educated *too well*. In urban areas (where people are generally better educated), there were opposition newspapers. An opposition arose, and ZanuPF had a chance to lose an election (it is unheard of in Africa that the “liberation” party ever loses an election).   newlinechar  newlinechar This was the beginning of the sh*t in Zimbabwe. Mugabe then started to organize the farm invasions. The farms did not go to the best educated people to run the farms – the farms either went to government ministers or “war veterans”.

It is not the end result. newlinechar  newlinechar So don't kid yourself that things are better now than in 1968.

I have never encountered anyone who had problems swimming in red tides, and I saw quite a few living in San Diego for &gt;5 years.  Red tides, far as I know, are caused by a wide variety of species, many of which are not harmful to shellfish - I never remember any shellfish warnings when they occurred in SD.  Surprisingly, although the little bugs grow brightly when you disturb the water (which is why the waves glow), they grow much more brightly when you pee on them.

Fair enough.  Why shouldn't college students be allowed to choose whether they vote in their college state rather than their home state?  They live in the college state 8.5+ months or perhaps more of the year.  I would think that it makes a lot more sense to have them voting in those elections, rather than in the elections of a state where they just, perhaps, spend off time.
agreed, but what is the cause of murder? Instead of putting a band-aid on the problem, we should truly fix things. newlinechar  newlinechar In the case of murder, it probably has something to do with money or love.

I would like to share an e-mail with you that our President and COO wrote: newlinechar  newlinechar I very much appreciate the time you took to share your feelings with me.  What happened in this restaurant by one of our managers was absolutely unacceptable and we will not tolerate this ever happening again.  I spoke with Ms. Greenberg today, as has other senior management, to offer our sincerest apologies.  I can’t even begin to imagine how much this situation has hurt Ms. Greenberg and her daughter.

Well to be completely honest,  I personally think that being religious says a lot about your ability to come to sound conclusions when you believe in something as absurd and asinine as a man walking on water and coming back from the dead.  But that's just me personally, I don't like the idea that people truly believe in something because its in one book that has no facts to back it up besides this thing called 'faith.'  But since no atheist could ever be elected in America (not right now at least) and being atheist doesn't mean you are the best candidate I think RP is right, their record and character should be the basis of why we elect them.  I do not agree with Ron Paul's religious beliefs but I do agree with his message of freedom, liberty, and the Constitution.

Your reasoning would stand if college weren't the method of becoming qualified for almost every job above entry level.

Your experience? newlinechar  newlinechar I went looking for hard numbers on the subject just now (not for the first time), but couldn't find them in sufficient detail, much less all in one place.  I'd really appreciate it if anyone could provide such a thing.  From what little I did find, Ronald Reagan was very much an underdog against incumbent Ford at this point in the '76 election, and Ford in fact won more primaries than Reagan. newlinechar  newlinechar Apart from any of that, though, this race is unique in several important respects:   newlinechar  newlinechar  1. An overwhelming majority of americans oppose the current war, while all but one of the republican candidates support it.  All anti-war+republican voters therefore must concentrate their votes on that one candidate, while there are several pro-war candidates splitting the rest, with no clear front-runner. This may not matter that much to convention delegates and the GOP brass, especially if some of the current front-runners drop out and throw their support against Dr. Paul.  The party players would probably rather lose the election than win with a candidate who endangers their way of life.  But if he does well enough, they'd be killing the party to ignore the will of its members at large. newlinechar  2. Approval ratings of the republican president *and* the democratic houses of congress, are at *all-time* historical lows.  Many things contribute to this, but it is clearly a measure of dissatisfaction with the status quo. I would argue that candidates promising substanative and *specific* change are now favored by those paying attention, and will be increasingly favored by the population at large as time goes on. newlinechar  3. Polling methods have never been *less* representative of the general population, let alone people who are *actually* likely to vote in the primaries.  Many people have elucidated this point; if you have objections to it, please state them and I'll do my best to answer.

Sorry that it took a while to respond, been a busy week. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Don't forget that the possibility exists for someone to come up with a super-fast way to implement whatever algorithm you might use. As far as I'm concerned, N rounds of SHA-256 or Whirlpool is as good as bcrypt, scalable, and much easier to get right. Specifically, those algorithms are built into everyone's frameworks already. newlinechar  newlinechar The key issue here is not what algorithm to use, but how slow you can make it to check one possible password. Bcrypt is good as it has long initialization time, and that is needed for each try. So it is rather unlikely that there would be major advances on setup. newlinechar  newlinechar But the key point here is that you should use some cryptographic protocol when checking for password. Even simple N times SHA-256 (which as algorithm is just about as fast as SHA-1 BTW) is much better than single SHA-256+salt. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I don't disagree with you, except in salt being a 'band-aid'. A good design has 'layers' as you said yourself, and includes both a slow digest algorithm and salt, among other things. newlinechar  newlinechar That is where I disagree with you. newlinechar  newlinechar Nonce, or salt, is added to password or other data to prevent use precalculation (or rainbow) tables. And using any decent crypto protocol, especially with custom number or recursion, makes it very unlikely that attacker would have precalculated tables to match your setup. newlinechar  newlinechar And that is all that salt does, it prevents one type of attack that is more or less prevented already anyway. It does not add to security, as anyone who can access your password file or database can also get the salt value that was used. newlinechar  newlinechar So basically if we assume that other security measures have failed, and the attacker now has your users password file. There are two things that protect your users passwords. newlinechar  newlinechar 1. How strong passwords your users have used newlinechar  newlinechar 2. How long it takes to calculate single password hash newlinechar  newlinechar And that is where use of suitable crypto protocol and slow algorithm is crucial. Your attacker probably has a botnet at his disposal, either own or he buys calculation time from one. So he has the computational power of 10000  relatively modern PCs or so.  newlinechar  newlinechar Breaking any fast hash algorithm using hybrid dictionary attack (SHA-X, MD-X, etc) is doable for at least significant portion of those passwords. newlinechar  newlinechar But if you manage to slow things down 100-1000 times, you have pretty good chance of frustrating the attacker.   newlinechar

'Corporations are mandated by law to pursue profit.'  Wrong wrong wrong wrong.  
Let's see. Your first link, http://www.clasp.org/publications/marriage_brief3_annotated.pdf, includes such gems as: 'children raised by same sex parents are no more likely to exhibit poor outcomes than children raised by heterosexual parents ... children of gay or lesbian parents do not look different from their counterparts raised in heterosexual divorced families regarding school performance, behavior problems emotional problems, early pregnancy, or difficultities finding employment.' and 'There may be certain benefits to marriage, such as access to health insurance and tax advantages, that contribute to the increased likelihood of child well-being. In addition, it remains possible that those who marry also have attributes unmeasured in existing surveys—such as commitment, loyalty, and future orientation—that distinguish them from those who don’t marry and stay married. It is also possible that marriage itself—the actual act of getting married—changes the attitudes and behaviors of couples in positive ways, as well as those of others towards them.' newlinechar  newlinechar So your first source seems to say that though positive benefits are correlated with marriage, they are unable to establish causation (surprise surprise), because people with certain qualities may self-select toward stable marriage. Furthermore, children raised by same-sex couples already appear statistically similar to those raised by heterosexual couples; it follows then, that if you believe marriage is a positive force for the child, it would only be a benefit, not some sort of catastrophic failure of civilization. newlinechar  newlinechar Your second article is inaccessible; are you accessing it from somewhere with a subscription, or are you just throwing every article you can find at me, even if you can only provide an abstract? I doubt someone of your intellectual stature is writing from a library or university. newlinechar  newlinechar Your third article is inaccessible, but I'll quote a summary of their findings for you: 'Our findings suggest that children can potentially benefit from living with a cohabiting partner whose resources are shared with family members. Although children living with married rather than cohabiting parents fare better in terms of material well-being, this advantage is accounted for by race and ethnic group and parents' education.' Can you understand what your own research is saying? Marriage is an effect, not a cause. newlinechar  newlinechar Your fourth article is, again, inaccessible; I'm not driving to campus to do your research for you. I'll quote, again, from the abstract for you: '(1) family net wealth and total private transfers vary with family structure along three lines, marriage-remarriage, marriage-cohabitation, and male-female single parenthood; (2) marriage is a wealth-enhancing institution; (3) private transfers promote family net wealth; and (4) marriage reinforces the promoting effect of private transfers on family wealth.' In other words, marriage is an economic benefit (something no one denies, and which is actually one of the major arguments in favor of same-sex marriage). newlinechar  newlinechar In summary, though you claim 'Evidence shows that marriage is the best structure for raising children,' it's clear that there's no clear causative relationship between marriage and improved child welfare; rather, the correlative effects are confounded by the external variable problems of how ethnicity and socioeconomic status affect one's likelihood to marry and stay married. Allowing same-sex couples to marry, as should be their right as adult citizens, would merely extend the economic benefits of marriage to a relatively small additional portion of the population, and would, if anything, correlate with improved child welfare. Are you so blinded by bigotry that you can't read what your own research is telling you?
I agree with your general reasoning (no real idea about this instance either way), though I would say that race being a crucial to the question of whether or not, or on whom, to carry out the attack qualifies it also as sort of hate crime. newlinechar  newlinechar Still, even assuming this was no hate crime, it doesn't really tackle the *selective moral outrage* -- not to mention the compulsive framing of every other incident as hate crime --, now does it?

&gt;'Traditional' marriage (since you seem to deny there is such thing) has always been man and woman. newlinechar  newlinechar No it hasn't.  In fact, for the majority of human history, the one man/multiple women marriage would be common in more cultures.  So it would actually be more accurate to refer to polygamy as 'traditional' marriage.  The whole idea of marriage for romantic love by itself is pretty new.  A few generations ago, marriage was mostly about property.

This guy is seriously overstating the situation. The people usually glance at your receipt and let you through without hesitation.

If you buy a big product (like a huge TV) they will look at the receipt to make sure you bought it and didn't just pick it up on your way out (this is actually MORE trusting than other big item stores who require you to show your receipt to pick up your item to begin with). It's fast, it's painless, and doesn't bother me in the least.  newlinechar

He is actually right there. newlinechar  newlinechar If you go the static way you don't need objects. Haskell has type classes, with is method overloading based on a datatype.

Which is easy enough to emulate, but actually has its purpose. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, OOP simply sucks at concurrency. You need either agents or referential transparity (read: declarative programming) newlinechar  newlinechar Nevertheless, the _success_ of OOP in the market place has to do with modularization.  newlinechar  newlinechar You can put buisniss logic concerning maintainability straight into the types in a  language like Java.

Regexp is a misnomer, anymore.  The language of [arbitrarily-nested] balanced parentheses is provably non-regular, but as you point out, a pattern can be constructed to match it anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar Larry Wall: newlinechar &gt;Regular expressions' [...] are only marginally related to real regular expressions. Nevertheless, the term has grown with the capabilities of our pattern matching engines, so I'm not going to try to fight linguistic necessity here. I will, however, generally call them 'regexes' (or 'regexen', when I'm in an Anglo-Saxon mood). newlinechar  newlinechar Fair point, though, that these extensions to regular expressions enable the programmer to match non-regular languages.  I'm not entirely sure why one would choose that approach over writing a true recursive-descent parser, but it has a certain amount of nifty.

&gt;So given that you repeated the same argument over and over newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar No, I drew that argument from the research you presented. You presented your 'scientific facts' in the form of journal articles, and I pointed out how they were not stating at all what you apparently thought they were. You will now, of course, distance yourself from them in an effort to defend your original position. You can't have it both ways, either you trust a source or you don't - if you thought they were valid enough sources on which to base your frivolous argument before, then stand by them. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My own stance is that the effect on children or society is essentially irrelevant; barring people from rights others have is unjust. For historical analogies, it would be like preventing black men or women from voting simply because of the societal upheaval their suffrage might cause. Either someone is a full-fledged citizen or they aren't; currently, we are not treating homosexual people as citizens. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar However, I chose to meet your argument on its own merits. Again, from one of *your own articles*: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Our findings suggest that children can potentially benefit from living with a cohabiting partner whose resources are shared with family members. Although children living with married rather than cohabiting parents fare better in terms of material well-being, this advantage is accounted for by race and ethnic group and parents' education newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Your argument is groundless and your efforts to defend are intellectually deficient. You claim that I have yet to prove my thesis, when in fact I can cite my thesis almost word for word from your own sources.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar P.S. How is divorce relevant here? Would you ban that as well, in 'thinking of the children,' as clearly it would have a worse effect than them living in a stable same sex household. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar P.P.S. I'm not seeking to prove my own intellectual stature to you - I feel no need; I am merely mocking yours. When someone approaches a question with scholarly rigor instead of waving their hands and saying 'science proves it,' I treat them with respect. You, instead, began with platitudes such as 'marriage between a man and a woman is the best environment for a child' and then fruitlessly sought to defend that with evidence. This, combined with your overall inability to grasp the basics of rhetoric and construction of an argument, are what lead me to believe that you're most likely not writing from a university or library.

Agreed.

&gt;I never said anything about romantic love, and frankly, polygamy is still 'man/woman.' Why is that so hard? Do you insist on [blah blah blah]... newlinechar  newlinechar What Huckabee said (and what you seem to be supporting) was no civilization has ever 'rewritten what marriage... means' and survived.  Right?  I gave numerous examples about how marriage has been rewritten.  In fact, changing the number of people involved in marriages seems like a pretty fundamental rewrite, doesn't it?  'No, that doesn't count because it's still *mostly* heterosexual!' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Well, I am familiar with the studies conducted trying to prove that there were gay marriages in medeival societies, and frankly, considering that 70-80% of Academics are left-leaning... my assumptions are not off-base. newlinechar  newlinechar What happened in 'medeival' societies isn't really relevant.  I wasn't really arguing that they had the modern concept of gay marriage in medieval times, just that the concept of marriage has undergone fundamental changes throughout history. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I apologize - they are my responses on this thread. I am the only one arguing against it here :). newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, the reason for that is you're wrong and everyone else is right. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It has everything to do with children and the role of marriage in our society. It is not specifically anti-same-sex marriage, but more pro-preserving our current definition of marriage. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Pro-preserving our current definition of marriage'?  Wow, that's a load of bullshit!  How about we concern ourselves with protecting people's rights instead of protecting the definitions of words. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Marriage is the best situation to raise a child in. newlinechar  newlinechar I definitely agree.  And since millions of gay couples are raising kids *right now*, we could improve those children's lives by allowing their parents to get married. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Men and women are also different in a host of ways, so in an optimal situation (and considering the research), having a biological mother and father in a married relationship is the best situation for a child to be in. newlinechar  newlinechar Okay, but, I can think of an infinite number of less than optimal situations for kids to be in, but I don't think the government should be in the business of deciding which situations are legally 'optimal', and which ones aren't.  Marriage should be available to any couple who wants it. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, lots of research says that the children of gay parents do just as well ass their straight-parented counterparts.  I also know some gay couples who would make truly awesome parents.  Who the fuck are you to say they shouldn't be encouraged to start a family? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That doesn't mean a same-sex couple is not 'second best' which I believe it is. I am more adamantly against single parenthood and angry divorces and out-of-wedlock births, frankly, because of their destructive nature on children. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, we can't outlaw any of those things, can we? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But the point remains: having a married mother and father is best. Expanding the current definition of marriage (since you barred the use of 'traditional' even though it is valid) to include more and more 'situations' muddies the waters and expands the situations children can be placed in, creating a host of new situations that are inferior for them to be brought up in. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't believe that's true.  Allowing gay marriage isn't going to make more people gay or lead to 'inferior' situations for kids.  It isn't going to create more gay households.  After all, it's already legal to be gay and raise kids, and millions of families are doing so.  All that's left to do is to give them the all legal protections that my wife and I take for granted. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That's all, really, and so if same-sex advocates could admit that scientifically and philosophically a married opposite-sex couple is better for children, I think I'd be more inclined to be sympathetic. newlinechar  newlinechar Why would they admit something that's not true?  And even if it were true, why is that enough reason to deny marriage rights?

You really think McDonalds cares about kids grades?

That's about 6,000 kids.  Now kids have parents and many have a sibling or two who, unfortunately don't get a free meal.  So, again, just to make it easy, let's keep this at two additional mouths per kid to account for single parents/1 sibling or only 1 child with 2 parents.  Then that is 2 people that are most likely going to eat with the child that got the free meal.  say they spend on average $10.  thats safely $60,000 revenue (minus the 'at-cost' price of the free meal) for a measly $1,600 investment in addition to the 'awwww, McDonalds cares about our children' feel-good factor. newlinechar  newlinechar Corporations exist for one reason: to put money in the pockets of their shareholders.

There was a study done recently on the effects of legalizing hard drung use in the UK. They actually only criminalized it because of pressure from the US.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's a program where you have to be a current using addict. This is diagnosed by the doctor. The doctor then writes you a script for the ammount you are currently taking. You get clean drugs, regulated ammounts, in various forms. If you inject, you get clean needles, if you smoke it they can lace it into your favorite pack of cigarettes. You still pay for it, but since it's not illegal for you to have it, you get a higher quality product, and a safer product, at a lower price than the street market.  newlinechar  newlinechar It showed that when this program was in place crime rates dropped dramatically. It also showed that a good ammount of people voluntarilly weened themselves off whatever drug they were taking. They got their fun and then moved on.  newlinechar  newlinechar The stigma of being an addict in our society is so great, I feel it can be a detriment to those who may otherwise have just done it for a year or so and then dropped it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Granted not everyone in the study did so. Some remained addicts, but it was no longer affecting their health. Pure drugs, even hard drugs, aren't as damaging to the body as one may think. It's the additives and crap that gets put in them on the street that is so bad for you. They were able to hold jobs, repair their familiy lives, quit destructive behaviors like prostitution and gambling and stealing to get money for their next fix.  newlinechar  newlinechar Having the drug use in the open actually did seem to help the situation, not hurt it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'll try to find the source and link it here.

A great Australian comic expressed why rape jokes don't work thusly: when you start making jokes about rape in a comedy club, the women in the audience start thinking about being raped, which (what a suprise) makes them less inclined to laugh, and also makes them hate the comedian for making them think about something horrible. The men who are there with the women then become angry at you as a comedian, for ruining the fun night they had planned. It's very hard for an audience to laugh at jokes when they hate the person delivering them.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In my comedy-watching experience rape jokes usually trade on shock value; they are also usually gay-rape jokes (as above), which trade on homophobia.

It's utter bullshit to think that these 'subprime' borrowers thought they could actually afford the houses they were picking up.  Everyone I know who used one of these mortgages was living in a Speculative dreamworld where house prices NEVER came down.  I personally know 2 people who have purchased multiple homes hoping to get rich.  They used ARMs to leverage as much of their assets as possible into real estate.  Meanwhile, I thought these people were crazy -- prices were completely unsupportable if looking at the fundamentals (such as local salaries).  If the government decides to bail out these folks, then I will be screwed twice: the market will not adjust, so I'll never be able to afford to buy my own home, and as a taxpayer I'll be on the hook for paying for the bailout.  Now, tell me, if I went to Las Vegas and gambled away a bunch of money on borrowed credit, would you be happy if the government made you pay my gambling debt?  Because that's EXACTLY what I think the government is asking taxpayers to do -- Pay for the speculative gamble of subprime borrowers.

I have mixed experiences. I felt a lot safer walking around wherever I wanted when I lived in Japan, a place with few guns, than the US where gun ownership is pretty high. Then again, I felt more danger when I walked into bars in Scotland, even though the danger wasn't getting shot, but it definitely felt like the people were more into fighting in general, and perhaps the low chance of getting shot had something to do with that. 
In case you haven't been paying attention, there are a lot of people who see same-sex marriage as a terrible threat to traditional marriage.

Oh, right. That's probably it.
Mutual tolerance for me means that only tolerant views are tolerated. Romney's speech reveals his views are not tolerant. Abstinence-only education, abortion bans, brainwashing children in schools are examples of intolerance and bigotry and aggression. Sharia law is an example of barbaric intolerance which is incompatible with human nature as I understand it. Etc etc etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Claiming this stuff has nothing to do with religion makes as much sense as claiming evolution is just a theory. There is a theory that religion is the culprit, and it is confirmed by millions of experiments. This makes it a scientific fact. newlinechar  newlinechar And I'm not talking about faith in general. Faith is not the same as religion. What I'm talking about are inconsistent and fossilized belief systems exploiting certain traits of human psychology and certain human instincts. These are systems which have built organizations around them, systems which have been beaten into people's heads since childhood, systems which do irreparable damage to their mental health, and which force people to live in constant denial of reality and common sense. And btw, this reality they are in denial of - this reality includes you and me. And I don't like it. When a driver on the road is in denial of reality, that's a usually a DWI, or at least reckless driving. When a president or a teacher in school is in denial of reality, I must be tolerant. newlinechar  newlinechar Btw, 'atheism' does not necessarily mean the opposite of such a belief system. In my life I've had enough of Marxism-Leninism which in Soviet interpretation became a bona fide religion exactly of the kind I hate. newlinechar  newlinechar Being tolerant to these religions is *dangerous.* I can turn my other cheek and you can, but for society it means disaster. It means cessation of any progress and regression to stone age. And there is no overgeneralization here. When a person steals or kills, you lock him up. You don't say 'it would be an overgeneralization to claim he could kill again'. When people from another country start mass killings of your people, it's not an overgeneralization to call it a war and to defend yourself. When people of certain beliefs become detrimental to the society, it is not an overgeneralization to call these beliefs *wrong,* to denounce them, and to prevent these people from affecting the society. And that's what should be done. newlinechar  newlinechar I wouldn't call myself an atheist, though I'm also not an agnostic in the popular meaning of 'bible could be right'. I don't believe a deity could exist, but even if I would admit the possibility, I would never accept the worship-me fag-hating deity. I see where this stuff is coming from and it is not Heavens.

&gt;Einstein believed in a creator.  newlinechar  newlinechar Einstein believed in a God, but certainly not in the sense you mean.  But if you believe in a God like Spinoza's, then i am willing to accept that it is possible.  Even then, though, there is no evidence at this point for such a being, and therefore no logical reason to believe in it. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not the belief in God, but the belief in religion that i find most distasteful.  But, honestly, as long as it doesn't affect me, you can believe what you want.  I think people who believe in religions are irrational idiots.  They are free to disagree with me.

A basic principle in linguistics is that you can tell a language's geographic region of origin by looking for the area where there are the most closely related variants spread over the smallest distance.  In the case of English, if you didn't know any better, because there are so many more native English speakers in North America than on any other continent, you might think that English had originated there.  On the other hand, if you looked for the most amount of variants of English over the shortest geographical distance, you would immediately home in on the British Isles and Frisia and Saxony.

Ok, let me tell you about a girl. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar She had no breasts, was flat-chested. This felt wrong to her, unfair. Sometime after high school she decided to wear a type of external prosthesis, the kind a patient with mastopexy would wear. The change in the way she perceived herself and how people around started to react to her presence was AMAZING... so she kept wearing that type external prosthesis. All was fine in exterior but the girl developed a serious fear o intimacy. The simple thought of being naked with someone was enough to throw her in anxiety and depression.  newlinechar  newlinechar My favorite cup is a small B, I like them present but aerodynamic and I have seen enough imperfect but still splendid breasts being changed on a whim.

I make testing tools for several different machines.   Tests from the old tool won't work on the next one, but we still need to test those machines.   The old tests were just a table of what commands to send, but it didn't support complex tests (that is it could turn a light on and off, but could turn a motor on until the temperature reached some value and then open a valve).    newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So my python script read those old tables, and converts to the new system.   The old system had a lot of almost duplicate rows - the same command to turn some warning light one, except they applied to different machines.   So my hash table took the row as a key, but took out what machine it applied to, and threw a duplicate test exception if the remainder existed, which was caught at a higher level and just applied the existing test to that machine.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There are about 10 different tests for each warning light, split among 1000s of different models.   We want to corrolate these tests because we have found many cases where the test didn't work on one machine becuase we had the wrong command (often the documentation was wrong), and further investigation revealed that most (but not necessarly all) machines that use that test had the wrong command, so we need to know what machines to go back and re-test. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Without revealing too much that is why I was doing it.

That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. ...Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.'

A great deal of information is implied by the zip+4, so much that you will not be in 3NF if you actually store the zip along with the rest of the information traditionally written on an envelope. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to support multi-national addresses, the best thing to do is store a blob of text with the whole address in it and don't plan on doing any verification at all. newlinechar  newlinechar One solution a friend of mine is using is to store a big blob of text and then throw regexes across it to pull out information like the city, state, zip, etc. via stored procedures.

I haven't looked into that; it sounds cool, but again, you're going to lose on foreign addresses.

Well thanks for the discussion.  A few final points on my end, and I'll give you the last word: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Thank you for not resorting to personal attacks.  I get voted down, obviously, but you haven't been screaming bigot at me like so many others on this thread do, and I appreciate having a discussion with someone that actually listens to opposing points of view without labeling them first. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) I understand the argument that marriage is the *result* of a committed relationship, but I ask this question:  If an option to publicly label one's committed relationship is removed, will that not damage relationships because they have no way of taking that extra step?  In my mind, marriage is not a label, but an extra step.  If it weren't, than the piece of paper wouldn't mean anything and committed non-married couples would be the same as married couples statistically. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Nope. I also wouldn't give preference to couples over single parents. Everything should be handled on a case-by-case basis. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) There are obviously some situations where a single parent would be better than a couple of some sort.  Making same-sex marriage legal and on the same plane as opposite-sex marriage takes away the ability of adoption agencies to choose a married, opposite-sex couple over same-sex all things being equal, even given that scientifically a married opposite-sex couple is best *and* a child would have access to a mother *and* a father in one, and two of one (and therefor not getting the benefits of the inherent natural differences in the sexes) in the other. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;However, not having a parent of one particular sex doesn't rule out having role model of that sex. Aunts, uncles, family friends, etc. That is something that the case worker would take into consideration. newlinechar  newlinechar 4) Role models are great, and they are needed.  But that is not the same as a mother or father, and it never will be obviously. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I would never preclude someone from adopting based solely on their orientation, though. newlinechar  newlinechar 5) I never would either.  It has everything to do with selecting the best situation for a child that is presently available to the child. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks again for the post.

When Microsoft says 'IE X will support Y', you can bet it will actually only support about 75% of Y, with bugs and whatever design was convenient for them giving the prior structure of the browser. newlinechar  newlinechar Honestly, if they said they were going to support CSS3, I just plain wouldn't believe them, and certainly wouldn't structure my plans around having CSS3 in a year. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not trying to be sarcastic or cynical here; I'm trying to be informed by history. Microsoft doesn't have any credibility on this front anyhow, so who cares what they say?

They did sort it out. Unfortunately, there are no cases quite like this as a precedent. As a result, the police couldn't technically charge her with anything illegal. Although it was highly immoral, there wasn't any charge they could give her that they could prove.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's important to note that she was aware this girl had a history of depression and mental instability. She was aware that hateful messages were being sent to her. She was the instigator of this revenge profile. And while she asked the other friends, whom she gave access to the account, to not be mean. She did at one point encourage them to give this girl a taste of her own medicine. Apparently she had been hurtful to the daughter in the past.  newlinechar  newlinechar I also find it interesting that it was one of the girls involved that actually outed this woman! She didn't even have the decency to turn herself in. She claims that she didn't think this girl was going to kill herself. However, she did know she was clinically depressed and in treatment for it. Depression is a major factor in suicide. Perhaps messages that say things like 'the world would be better off without you', from a depressed teenage girl's perspective, are all the proof one needs.  newlinechar  newlinechar I find it disgusting that a grown woman would set up a revenge account with her daughter, then include others in it, then claim to not be responsible for the outcomes.  newlinechar It's disgusting.  newlinechar  newlinechar But vigilante justice is not the answer, but the community rallying around the family who has tragically and needlessly lost their daughter while shunning the person who enabled that...no problem with me.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Each U.S. state has its own statute which dictates how much interest can be charged before it is considered usurious or unlawful. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If a lender charges above the lawful interest rate, a court will not allow the lender to sue to recover the debt because the interest rate was illegal anyway. In some states (such as New York) such loans are voided, meaning made void from the beginning or ab initio. Ref NY Gen Oblig 5-501 et seq. and NY 1503. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;However, there are separate rules applied to most banks. In 1980, due to inflation, national banks (banks that generally include N.A. in their name), federally chartered savings banks, installment plan sellers and chartered loan companies were exempted from state usury limits by the federal government through a special law.

With CTM, Knuth and Java under your belt, learning C would be an afternoon project. newlinechar  newlinechar SICP and Knuth will give you all the assembler you need. SICP has you building a virtual machine that runs it's own assembly, then building an interpreter on that virtual machine that is complete enough to run the virtual machine.  Knuth uses a simplified assembly for everything. The register machine is not forgotten in my list ;)
I would say a mix - java is definitely in the mix...but I am not a fan of C++ either, so it doesn't make it any better

Military families take the office of the President (aka Commander &amp; Chief) very seriously.  They have faith that the governing authorities would always treat the military with the proper respect and would never abuse their authority over the military for political or self-gain.  I would call it true believer syndrome.  For Shrub to loose the military families is very telling.  Military families faith in government is based on honor above self. newlinechar  newlinechar To admit that the commander in chief has no honor is to admit to oneself that America is really 'amerika'.  Almost parallel to Jesus dropping from the sky and announcing on television that he is handing the keys over to Lucifer, Hades, or Osiris. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides like any Guassian curve, one you are 2/3 past the peak (ratings) any further loss is becomes statistically extremely difficult to materialize. newlinechar  newlinechar I would think that forgiveness and compassion would be necessary to bring this country together to repair the mess.  Punish the criminals and educate the victims to protect themselves.  How will we as a people be able to drain the swamp of corruption out of D.C. unless we can talk to people with other points of view? newlinechar 
Romney believes in God.  So do a lot of people running for president.  So have a lot of past presidents.  There are a lot of religious people in the United States.  That doesn't make us bad people or inhibit our ability to make good decisions.  
He and his wife got divorced-- yet he wants to find (better?) work give his children (more?) support and then help support his girlfriends children.  We don't know the lives of those people Quinn.

The reality is you simply don't know the circumstances of their lives.

This is perhaps the wrong forum to discuss this but the only reason you think that's prime real estate is because you believe in god. newlinechar  newlinechar Prime real estate is tahiti, fiji, montana, california, and a thousands of other breathtakingly beautiful places in the world.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know why your imaginary man in the sky promised you that shithole real esteate.

&gt;they had to make a conscientious decision to make Mandarin the official dialect because Cantonese was also a very popular dialect for the island. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I thought the second most popular dialect in Taiwan is Min-nan. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Mandarin is just the Beijing dialect that the Communist chose to standardize as the national dialect. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Actually Mandarin standardization was one of those controversial long-term visionary projects that goes way before the communists, like the Three-Gorges Dam.  The Qing dynasty were the first to push Mandarin as the official language, but were somewhat unsuccessful in enforcing it.  The ROC and PRC were much more successful, because superior transportation and communication technologies gave the governments much stronger sphere of influence. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And on the broader scale, most Chinese speak some dialects other than Mandarin newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I am Chinese, and as far as I know, some dialects are mostly tonal variations of Beijing Mandarin, while others sound completely different.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar For example, Mao and Deng weren't speaking Mandarin with accent, they were actually speaking in their native tongues all the time (Hunanese and Sichuanese respectively), yet they can easily be understood by Mandarin speakers. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Cantonese, however, sounds completely different.  Even though it's based on the same writing system, it's completely unintelligible to Mandarin speakers.  There is an ongoing debate in academia on whether to categorize Cantonese as a dialect, or a different language family.
First thing you should read the latest UN assessment. It came out a few months ago. newlinechar  newlinechar More then 1300 scientists participated in it.

Penn's opinion of the films is only that, his opinion.  He didn't give a considered appraisal of their aesthetic value, just called films about hobbits shit.  Well that's not intelligent criticism, just the opinion of an ahole.  Penn shouts as if this gives his opinions more authority.  His feigned anger is as lame as Bill O'Reilly's.  Redditors like Penn's schtick more because his sentiments are closer to their own.  Penn generally goes after the low hanging fruit: bottled water is expensive and foolish (gee, really?), polling can be an instrument of propaganda(he figured this out in 2007?), gun control laws mostly work against those who respect the law (damn, next he'll discover that criminals are lawbreakers)... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong, we do live in times when the restatement of the obvious may be the first duty of intelligent men (Orwell), but Penn's rants take far too long to say far too little.  A more interesting approach wouldn't be to conclude 'Fuck you Frank' because then one simply resorts to rejecting polls categorically, a fool's position.

Minersville School District v. Gobitis newlinechar  newlinechar In this case it had to do with saluting and pledging to the flag. Jehovah Witnesses consider this an act of idolatry and when two children had to be moved to private school because they refused to salute the flag the parents sued.

This is the part where you make a leap, I think: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; No, it has to do with the fact that I need to put my trust somewhere, and I'm not about to go all 'free market' when it comes to my health. When my doctor prescribes something to cure my daughter's ear infection, I trust that he knows what he's doing and that what he prescribed went through as much testing as possible to make sure that it's not only safe, but also does the job it's supposed to do. newlinechar  newlinechar We were talking about being assured that medicine was safe, but now we're talking about the doctor. Why are you taking your daughter to a doctor that would ever prescribe quack medicine? If he'd use non-approved stuff, isn't he the problem, not the medicine? newlinechar  newlinechar There's already an approval organization for doctors, and Paul doesn't want to be rid of it. Doctors already have to pick and choose medicines, even an FDA approved one can be inappropriate in the extreme. And it'd be malpractice either way. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think it would be burdening doctors, to add this in. They're already expected to keep up on this stuff, and read journals, and those that would ever prescribe quack medicine without the best of excuses (she was dying of cancer anyway, and though not approved by an independent testing lab, this was her best chance... in the FDA days it would have been on trial anyway, and I'd have tried to get her admitted to it) should lose their license. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Aside from the FDA and CDC coming out with rules on how to properly handle and cook meat, you mean? newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps, but most people aren't in the habit of boiling their lettuce. The problem is factory farming, but nothing will happen there. Too much profit. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You live in some parallel utopia where all customers are smart and all companies put their customers ahead of a buck. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd rather have $1 a month from a customer for life, than kill him selling him a $100 product. Especially if I'm then on the hook for $50 million in liability. newlinechar  newlinechar And I don't live in a parallel utopia. I live in your favorite world, where companies don't even bother developing drugs that would save thousands of lives, because the cost to get FDA approved is more than the profit could ever be.

Last time I went into a Best Buy, their computers weren't able to access the Tubes.

It probably isn't to abolish it in a single day. newlinechar  newlinechar If you had suggested this, most people would agree, me too. I think that Paul agrees here. Hell, even if private companies can do this, what about the interim? It'd take them 5 years to be viable, and we can't go 5 years without any oversight at all. newlinechar  newlinechar I know that Paul has transitionary policies in mind for all of this. And just because he wants all these seperate things, doesn't mean that he gets to do them even if we vote him in. We can vote him into office, and then apply social pressure on some of the stranger ideas if we want that. newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike Bush and the current Congress, I think the man will really listen to us. That's so rare, that passing up the chance to get him into office would be a bad mistake. We won't get that again for a very long time, and maybe never.

Sorry I can't provide citations, but I did read that the reduction in penile cancer is considerably less than the (low) risk of the procedure itself. newlinechar  newlinechar To my mind, having the old purple helmet drastically desensitized for a reduction in the risk of STDs is too high a price to pay, and certainly not one anyone should be imposing on children without their consent.  Better to educate them to use a condom and stay away from sluts. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, it does suck if it has to be done later, but it would also suck (relatively) to have an insensitive penis.  I know I'll get downmods from people who can't bear the thought that they might be missing out on something, but people who've had it done in later life say that sensitivity goes down from about a 10 to 2 or 3.  e.g. uncut men couldn't stand to have their bell-end rubbing against underwear, for instance. newlinechar  newlinechar I watched a TV program about it, and in the US, young women asked in the street said they didn't like the idea of an uncut man.  Conversely, in the UK, where about 3% of men are circumcised, young women were disgusted by the idea of a circumcised man...  Any arguments about aesthetics are simply informed by the local societal norms. newlinechar  newlinechar Circumcision became popular in the US as a result of Mr Kellogg, of Cornflakes fame, who thought it prevented masturbation, and masturbation caused insanity.  He was wrong on both counts.  We don't use leeches any more - circumcision should go the same way.
As I said I'd be a responsible parent and not accept their illicit activity so casually as you insinuated should be done in your OP. Of course I wouldn't go insane because I know how harmful weed is (not at all) but as a responsible parent I'd have to know how they're getting marijuana because many people who sell it are dangerous criminals and if they experiment with other drugs. newlinechar  newlinechar What would you do 'uhh hey dw it's cool just keep puffin it up in my backyard'. Your kid doesn't see this anyway other than that you don't care about the fact that they're smoking an illegal drug. Most teenagers that experiment with weed do it because it's illegal and so they think it's the cool thing to do. These personalities are often attracted to other drugs which is why misinformed people keep saying Weed is a gateway drug for heroine and crystal meth and such. newlinechar  newlinechar If you turn a blind eye to this you really don't have any moral highground over that guy, and I understand him because unlike the self-righteous redditors I realize that not all people are perfectly informed about marijuana. Why else are people voting for Giuliani and Clinton if it were not that they were awfully misinformed?

If 1466A is declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court -- there's a current challenge before them that they have yet to schedule to hear -- then HR 3791 wouldn't apply to that material.

&gt;Thank you for not resorting to personal attacks. I get voted down, obviously, but you haven't been screaming bigot at me like so many others on this thread do newlinechar  newlinechar You're quite welcome.  I try never to personally attack someone I'm having a discussion with (unless they attack me first, in which case all bets are off).  It's counterproductive, at the very least.  Also, I haven't downvoted you at all.  I do my best to follow reddiquette, and only vote down posts that are uninformative and/or off-topic.  I find myself sorely tempted at times, but I certainly don't vote down people who are attempting to have an actual conversation. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if you feel the need to tell me that you can tell it's 'shopped by the pixels, or ask if 'u can has cheezburger', prepare to be downvoted (unless it's actually funny instead of a lame attempt to ride the meme bandwagon). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In my mind, marriage is not a label, but an extra step. If it weren't, than the piece of paper wouldn't mean anything and committed non-married couples would be the same as married couples statistically. newlinechar  newlinechar You can currently be married by a church without being legally married in the eyes of the law (look at Mormonism and polygamous marriages).  Likewise, you can obtain a marriage certificate without being wed religiously. newlinechar  newlinechar People often mentally merge the two, which makes these types of discussions difficult.  Basically, even if the state stopped recognizing marriage, people would still get married.   newlinechar  newlinechar So to respond to your comment, I think that marriage in the religious (and social) sense will always be available to people who want it, and marriage in the legal sense only indicates a greater commitment inasmuch as it forces people to put themselves in a legally actionable position with respect to their relationship.  Removing the legal option wouldn't damage any relationships, because they'd still have the religious (or social, if they're not religious) option available. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, being able to *display* a certain level of commitment is not the same as *having* that level of commitment.  Someone can be highly committed without being married, and someone can be poorly committed even when that *are* married.  The divorce rate is testimony enough to that.  So using marriage as a barometer for the commitment of a relationship is flawed from the beginning. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Making same-sex marriage legal and on the same plane as opposite-sex marriage takes away the ability of adoption agencies to choose a married, opposite-sex couple over same-sex all things being equal newlinechar  newlinechar And, all things being equal, that's great!  What you're proposing is that all things *aren't* equal, in which case I would expect the caseworker assigned to the child to make an appropriate decision as to what is best for the child.  Whether that decision fits with what *you* think is best for the child is another can of worms altogether;  One that could be opened even without the inclusion of same-sex marriages. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not trying to get in the last word, so feel free to respond if you wish.  I just have a habit of addressing any points that I feel need to be addressed, so I often end up with the last word after wearing down my 'opponent' in a war of attrition that I didn't even know I was fighting.
It's fundamentally different from programming, though, because medicine is recurring complexity while programming is new complexity.  Even if you know how to save a life, all 1000+ steps of it, there will still be lives needing saving.  But once you know how to solve a complex software problem, you have no reason to solve it again.  Any new problem will involve a different sequence of steps, because otherwise you'd just re-use the program you made for the first one. newlinechar  newlinechar I've written checklists several times for things like installation or build processes.  They invariably last no more than a couple days, because once I have the checklist, I can just turn it into a shell script, crontab, or makefile to run it automatically.  Then I don't need the checklist anymore, because the computer handles it for me.

&gt; Brainfart/typo. Read it as 'than'. Customers that don't die buy again. newlinechar  newlinechar That's not the disconnect I was referring to (I understood your point). newlinechar  newlinechar You blamed the E.coli outbreak on factory farming and referred to too much profit (one I agree with).  You then go on to imply that it's in the interest of companies to make a profit over the long term.  *There* is the disconnect.  If things were as you said, the E.coli outbreak would have never happened, right?  In addition, companies that did look out for their customers would be caught up in the media hype associated with tainted food (low spinach sales for a number of months). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; We laugh when 60 Minutes does an expose on $1000 hammers and accept it as a given, but then we talk about the FDA and it's an automatic assumption that they're giving us the best possible service for the lowest price? newlinechar  newlinechar The free market is charging $1000 per hammer, not the government.  The FDA has a fairly good track record of keeping the public safe with a few problems. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Doctors are already approved to weed out the quacks newlinechar  newlinechar Quack doctors?  Sure.  Quack medicine?  Not so much.  Then again, that's why there's peer review, which takes place in the FDA. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Coupled with a UL-like private testing firm, or even better with several, there's no real need for an FDA. newlinechar  newlinechar I would guess that one of your arguments against the FDA (as is one of mine) is their close work with 'big pharma' which may skew their approval process.  How would a private company (which would not have the legal or monetary resources of the US government) be able to do a better job and still pull a profit? newlinechar  newlinechar If you take a look at products in a drug store that are not approved by the FDA, there's a clear warning on it that says the FDA has not approved this product for the purpose it's being sold for.  Would you advocate the same in the FDA-less world?  Would you also apply the same rule to products that are not approved by the UL? newlinechar  newlinechar BTW, thanks for standing up to my arguments.  I find it rare that a libertarian gets their arguments past the equivalent of 'things will be better when Ron Paul is elected!1!11'.  I take back my earlier comment wondering aloud if you're stupid.
I posted the seven paragraphs of the article that couldn't be 'condensed' into ad hominem. Your proper response, then, would be either to admit that you shouldn't have included the entire article in your observation, or convinced me how what I pasted was all just in furtherance of argumentum ad hominem, as you had claimed.   newlinechar  newlinechar The 'tide' recognizes that you overstated your case to begin with and wouldn't qualify it when I pointed out its absurdity, but rather attacked me based on unfounded assumptions about my expectations and interests.
Because they do not have the same methodologies, due to the way they're conducted. newlinechar  newlinechar One of the biggest problems with exit polls is selection bias. Exit polls are only conducted in a few locations, and what if the interviewer only asks white people? Or only attractive people? Or only very old people? All these problems do not exist with properly conducted randomized phone opinion polls. newlinechar  newlinechar There is an even bigger problem, though. In order to have the results of an exit poll available on air as soon as polling ends, the polling organization stops the poll HOURS before the voting has ended. This results in late-hour voters not being represented. This was the huge problem in the 2004 exit polling, when morning polls showed Kerry as the overwhelming victor, but then the Republicans started outnumbering Democratic voters in the late hours, after exit polls have stopped being collected. newlinechar  newlinechar There's one more problem. In order for an opinion poll to be sufficiently accurate, it is very important for the participant to not be aware of what the poll will be used for. Otherwise, people might be inclined to try to influence the poll in some manner and less likely to tell the truth. Therefore, a typical questionnaire used by a political opinion poll looks something like this: newlinechar  newlinechar     How old are you? newlinechar     Do you think everyone should be allowed to own guns? newlinechar     Who is your most favorite baseball player? newlinechar     Do you prefer Pepsi or Coke? newlinechar     Did you vote in the last election? newlinechar     How many television sets do you have in your home? newlinechar     Has anyone in your family ever have cancer? newlinechar     Would you vote for Rudy Giuliani or Hillary Clinton? newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously, this is not possible in exit polls, which are usually as simple as, 'Who did you just vote for?'

I think what Rails really got right is that it took a bunch of 'good things', bound them up together, did it in a relatively disciplined way, and used a pleasant language.

Just because they were experts doesn't mean they couldn't be wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: About 1 second after posting I realized that my excerpt from the article could be interpreted as a straw man argument.  I'm not saying the whole article is bad because of that point.  That's just a part of it I particularly took issue with.  It's just that I think when they referred to religion and evolution being incompatible, they were thinking of a very assumptive interpretation of religion. newlinechar  newlinechar Their beliefs don't matter, only the facts they present.

I think that it is a good analogy.  If your athiest friend went around telling his parishioners the truth do you think that he would still be welcomed in the confesional?  Some people may use a priest in place of psychologist or conselor, most people expect the priest to be gods conduit.  If something miraculous were to happen in front of your friend: virgin mary on a piece of toast  ;)   your friend's atheism would influence his ability to handle the sign from god. Just like the scientist might view some major discovery with a perspective clouded with creationism or ID.  Maybe his faith would cause him to ignore or even hide the discovery.  If he wanted be upfront and put his beliefs on his c.v or cover letter then cool.  But no lab is going to want to take the chance that he will not do the best work posssible.

&gt; Jews establishing an empire in South America? Native Americans being their descendants? newlinechar  newlinechar Right, those notions contradict what archaeologists know about the natives coming down from the Bering Strait around 12K years ago (I'm going by memory here). And there's not a scrap of archaeological evidence to suggest the natives actually landed in South America and moved north (I'm assuming your summary of the Book of Mormon is accurate here). newlinechar  newlinechar Likewise, the Book of Exodus is completely misleading if one tries to read it as genuine history. It's the story of over half a million people enslaved in Egypt for hundreds of years and then wandering the desert to the east for forty years. As far as scientists can tell, that just didn't happen. As Lazare writes: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Not only was there a dearth of physical evidence concerning the escape itself, as archaeologists pointed out, but the slate was blank concerning the nearly five centuries that the Israelites had supposedly lived in Egypt prior to the Exodus as well as the forty years that they supposedly spent wandering in the Sinai. Not so much as a skeleton, campsite, or cooking pot had turned up, Finkelstein and Silberman noted, even though 'modern archeological techniques are quite capable of tracing even the very meager remains of hunter-gatherers and pastoral nomads all over the world.' Indeed, although archaeologists have found remains in the Sinai from the third millennium B.C. and the late first, they have found none from the thirteenth century. newlinechar  newlinechar Even if you ignore the 'magic stuff' like manna from heaven and the Red Sea parting, Exodus isn't 'somewhat plausible' as a historical text. It is implausible in the extreme. If you want to know the history of that region at that time, you're better off not to read the Old Testament, it will only fill your head with stuff you'll have to unlearn.

Cracking a password is O(1), and therefore P, if you're dealing with a single fixed output size compression function, as you know it'll be a fixed size table.  Even though that argument shows a misunderstanding, I'll grant you that assumption for now.   newlinechar  newlinechar Such a 'password cracking algorithm' relies on being able to exhaustively enumerate all the hashes with a corresponding password to generate it (note that it may not be possible to create such a table via brute force even with infinite computing power).  Once you have the table though, you can use it to crack any password in amortized O(1) time.  It's fixed size after all.  newlinechar  newlinechar However that a password hash that used an encryption algorithm instead of a compression function (storing the entire output) would require a brute-force attack, and that a dictionary attack could at best take advantage of bone-headed users who insist that 'Password1' is a good password even after it shows up in the dictionary.  It's a heuristic, suggesting that some inputs are more likely than others.  As such, it's an optimization in some cases, and a pessimization in others (No Free Lunch Theorem).  You can't ever calculate the entire table, any more than you can count all the way to infinity.  The best you can do is to 'memoize' the output for a particular attempt, so that if somebody gives it to you later, you can find it in amortized O(log n) time (not constant time anymore, because the size of the table is no longer bounded.  I'm feeling generous however, ans so I'll give you constant time multiplication and memory access).  And so you end up with O(2^n).  For the price of remembering _one_ _more_ _bit_, I can force you to have to calculate and remember everything you ever did, one more time. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, broadening the scope to NP problems.  All hash functions have some internal structure that we can use, if we can wrap our heads around it, to 'solve' it in less time than brute force (witness MD4, MD5, SHA1, etc).  Many NP-complete problem _instances_ also have such a structure.  If P==NP, then all of them do.  The problem is that you can't tell if there's structure to be taken advantage of until you've already found it (proof by contradiction:  a proof of P!=NP that uses such a technique would have to include an P algorithm to solve NP problems;  I can get you the paper if you want), and nobody has been able to come up with a good reason for literally random instances of 3SAT (for instance) to have such a structure.   newlinechar  newlinechar If there's no structure, then you have to fall back on the 'dictionary against variable length hash function' algorithm.  And then you're still stuck with the problem that adding one more city to your route will require doing all that n times again.

&gt;Firsty, it is unavoidable that sometimes the result is outside of the margin of error. newlinechar  newlinechar You have no understanding of what you're talking about. By the very definition of the term, the result is *inside* the margin of error. That's why they call it the 'margin of error'. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Even in the abstract 'ideal' case. 95% confidence means that it is espected that in 5% of the cases the result falls outside the bounds. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes. That's called 'margin of error'. See above. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;With so many polls, your statement therefore is not true. newlinechar  newlinechar This incorrect statement stems from you not having an understanding of what 'margin of error' means. See my first point above. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;All kinds of biases need to be filtered out, so you get a model that's used to 'process' the raw data newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, this is done. There are still some questions about the bias of some of the questions being asked, but in general, reputable polling organizations are aware of all the biases that go into this, and have ways to try to minimize them. They aren't perfect, though, and that is why they get the 'margin of error'. newlinechar  newlinechar P.S.: [MARGIN OF ERROR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error)
Worse, if the questions were asked vocally, how can we seperate biases from the person's body language, intonation, and inflection? newlinechar  newlinechar If the pollster asks with disgust in his voice 'Do you support Kucinich?' and then with unadulterated admiration 'Do you support Clinton?'... will that even show up in the methodology at all?

&gt; I don't know why you were downmodded; this is actually an excellent idea. newlinechar  newlinechar It's been discussed before at length. It's a very contentious issue with many downsides that took an event like 9/11 for it to even be considered. I doubt any political party would have considered it in response to the threat intell they had. They'd need to sell it to the public and pre-9/11 I doubt that would be possible.  newlinechar  newlinechar What should have been done was scaled up anti-terrorism operations, as well as making sure that airport security was aware of the threat. Plus the flying schools should have been monitored. Having the 'pilots' learn in the US was a stupid tactical mistake and it should have been picked up on given the intell available (the infamous 'determined to attack' report). newlinechar  newlinechar However, here's a good argument against arming pilots: it's not necessary any more. It only took a few hours for the world to come to the realization that a hijacking is now a potential suicide bomb. This was evident on Flight 93 where the passengers changed from the normal 'be compliant and you'll live' response to being held hostage to 'you have nothing to lose by fighting back'. You can bet that if anyone tries to hijack a plane again, the passengers will attack en-mass.

Islam is derived from the word 'salam' which means peace.Let's start with 'Killing' in Islam first because killing in itself is against the religion. In chapter 2 verse 190-193, It states that this is for a defensive war (no offense, because Islam is peace remember) and if a Muslim community or a person is attacked without any justification or opressed and are being prevented from practicing their religion/faith, then they have the permission to fight back, but even then the Muslim person or community are told not to transgress limits and are to stop and fighting if the attacker/enemy gives up. The muslim person/community are only to fight the attacker/enemy not innocent bystanders or non-combatants (hence suiciding bombing is against islam because innocent people are getting hurt every day). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now that we have that in mind. Now from what I remember (I'll check this when I'm at home later because I'm at work now) newlinechar  newlinechar Chapter 2 verse 256 states the freedom of religion.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Chapter 5 verse54 states that those who say that they believe in Islam then rejects his faith and opress or prevent other people who have accepted Islam will be fought against until they have given up. (see chapter 2 verse 190 - 193 about opressing above) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Chapter4 verse 137,  states that if those who believe and disbelieve over and over again, God (Allah) will never forgive them nor pardon them nor guide them until they change themselves first. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Chapter 16 verse 106 states that those who disbelieve in Allah after believing or says that she/he believes, but truly doesn't feel it in their heart, then he/she will be punished by Allah. It doesn't state that other muslims should punish those who left Islam. Only Allah knows the reasons on why they left and will judge them. No muslim has the right to judge people. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Chapter 3 verse 90 states that those have believed then disbelieves and have left the religion, then they will be lead astray (no guidance from God) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Anymore questions, I'll be gladly to answer them!

I've read a lot of Vonnegut's books, short stories, and essays.  Vonegut was ambiguous about religion.  He was a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church and explained his membership by saying the Unitarians were the closest religion to no religion at all, if I remember right. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Vonnegut really can't be included as a 'famous atheist'.  He never outright denied the existance of a God. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  His quote isn't represented fairly, it should have been attributed to the character in the book, but I'm sure that Vonnegut, at least most of the time,  felt that way.  He did plenty of questioning all his life.

I know a lot of people around here, some of whom are not nearly as well informed as they ought to be, if they are going to make such a serious choice about their lives. I do my part to help, but the point stands that if I like people who might be conned, and I describe to them the issues of such chicanery, then there are other people that I might like that are similarly uninformed. Not everybody has the impulse to research the nature of our society in the way that I do. This is fine, they have other interests that redeem them. Not everyone WANTS to be a reformer or a revolutionary. Whether they are in pursuit of higher goals(Science, arts, the desire to actually defend the country in the way our military was originally envisioned), or simply bludgeoned into apathy from current events, that does not mean they deserve to get sold a line. If someone does something and is fully informed of the possible consequences of their action, that is fine by me. That said, what many army recruiters do is nothing short of predatory, and if I can help the people around me to make an informed decision, rather than an uninformed one, I feel the better for it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Even people I don't like do not automatically deserve to be tricked. It's the ones I like that cause me concern.

This is the smugness I was talking about. The implication here is that religious people are unintelligent. Blanket slanders like that are beneath us all. newlinechar  newlinechar Religion has its flaws, some glaring and some minor. But so does atheism. Some would say that atheism isn't a movement, that it's an individual acceptance of one's perception of reality. Well so is religion. It's an individual acceptance of a perception of that same reality that just happens to be different than that of the atheist's. Where it becomes a movement is when you band together in groups and societies and  communities, official or otherwise, start writing manifestos and unifying value statements. Like it or not, atheism has become a movement, and as such it seeks to perpetuate itself. Atheism is every bit the mind-virus that Christianity is, it's just a different kind of sale.  newlinechar  newlinechar Either stop proselytizing or stop condemning the Christians for doing it. You're both doing the same thing and I'm tired of this undeserved feeling of superiority.

Uh, no, they do have a right to fire you.  Your job is not to fund-raise, your job is to preach.  Preachers often do have administrative roles, but their primary duty is to preach the word of God.  So if you won't do that, you're not doing your job.   newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, you've basically committed fraud, because you know that a fundamental aspect of your job is preaching God's word and you know you can't fulfill that.  Misrepresentation can be done by concealment as well as by assertion.  Since you knew that you would not able to fulfill the prime purpose of the job you were seeking, and took it anyway, you misrepresented yourself.  The contract can be voided.

This is a popular dismissal of expression that suggests real change is needed.  Truth is that frequently it takes a great deal of talking before a sufficient number of people are properly motivated to make meaningful change.  The Revolution simmers below the surface and as it heats the message spreads.  Spreading the word is crucial for this revolution to actually come off.  This revolutionary restoration of rights and freedoms can take place through elections if enough people really get the word.  The elections are not being held tonight.  You can be a cynic, but right now the action is on the web.  People talking.  People raising money to raise awareness.  When the elections come you will see more action and if enough people between now and then spread the word the results will be shocking to the cynics and elites so invested in the status quo. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Let's pursue the restoration of genuine American values peacefully through the vote so we don't have to contemplate something far bloodier.
I see myself holding a body length mirror in front of you.
Yes, it is far better that this change take place by a resounding declaration of American will to restore the best of American values.  We need people from both parties and from all over the political spectrum to recognize the importance of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Are you a Republican who thinks that legalizing drugs will be horrible for society?  Think through all the issues before rejecting Ron Paul for favoring freedom and due process of the law over those who profit from the drug war.  Are you a Democrat who thinks that aborting unborn babies is good because it makes women indistinguishable from men in an important respect?  Realize that Ron Paul wants to avoid the type of fight this nation had over slavery when the Supreme Court wrongly decided Dredd Scott and that left to the states to figure out is a better solution for your interests than something akin to the Emancipation Proclamation binding on every state. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, as for the 2nd, I'm armed.  Lots of people who support Paul are.  Let us hope and pray that it never comes to pass that Americans have to take up arms against fellow Americans to restore our rights, but let those who seek to deny Americans their rights may they take to heart Jefferson and Patrick Henry. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with **the blood of patriots** and **tyrants**.'  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me **liberty** or give me **death**!'  newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt;I'm not sure states would have to punish it, and they definitely wouldn't have to equate it with murder.

It can either be murder OR manslaughter! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That's leaving it up to the states, right? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Because if a fetus IS given 14th Amendment protections, there really isn't any *other* choice available.

'We' is Flying Frog Consultancy. newlinechar  newlinechar The single most important advantage of Windows Forms programming in F# compared to LablGTK in OCaml is the support provided by the interactive development environment. Specifically, Visual Studio's intellisense makes it extremely easy to learn an API like Windows Forms. newlinechar  newlinechar The equivalent calls in LablGTK are often comparably simple (although they tend to require weird castings through phantom-typed class hierarchies) but there is no way to explore the API interactively. OCamlbrowser is better than nothing but it doesn't even provide hyperlinks to related definitions, so it is very cumbersome to use by comparison. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, it isn't even feasible to add intellisense for LablGTK because OCaml's object system is structurally typed as opposed to .NET's nominally-typed OOP. This makes OOP in OCaml a better complement to the rest of the language because it is more dynamic and provides more freedom but that freedom means that an IDE is not likely to have sufficient information about the type of the object that you're invoking in order to pop up its methods. newlinechar

I've been writing software full-time in the popular dynamically-typed languages -- Perl, Python, Ruby -- since ~2000, so it's not an issue of unfamiliarity. newlinechar  newlinechar Smalltalk got it right (in fact, it got most things right, which most dynamically-typed language designers subsequently ignored) almost three decades ago. Then along comes Perl, which got it wrong at first, then introduced lexical scoping with strict mode, and therefore got it right. Similar story for Lua, except that Lua has the mistake of making common words unnecessarily long (e.g.: 'function' and 'local' keywords) and if you forget to define a variable local it automatically becomes global (!). newlinechar  newlinechar Neither Perl or Smalltalk have much syntactic overhead. I hope I'm not too rusty with either of them here: newlinechar  newlinechar Perl: newlinechar  newlinechar     my( $foo, $bar, $baz ) = ( 5, 10, 15 ); newlinechar  newlinechar ...with an alternative of: newlinechar  newlinechar     my $foo = 5; newlinechar     my $bar = 10; newlinechar     my $baz = 15; newlinechar  newlinechar Smalltalk: newlinechar  newlinechar     | foo bar baz | newlinechar     foo := 5 newlinechar     bar := 10 newlinechar     baz := 15 newlinechar  newlinechar If I recall correctly, Smalltalk also has some shortcuts (anyone care to comment?). newlinechar  newlinechar Neither of them is ideal, obviously, since there's some still noise. However, they demonstrate that it's possible to do it with a minimum of typing. If you were to mix Perl and Smalltalk's scheme, you could reduce the typing overhead to two characters for an arbitrary number of variables and assignments. Oh no! Two! Maybe one even, depending on the grammar, although that's probably too easy to miss when scanning code. newlinechar  newlinechar So I really don't understand this reticence that Python and Ruby harbor over a good idea. Ruby looks like it's slowly coming around. I'm happy that efforts are being made in Python to fix the scoping problems, but once again history is being ignored. newlinechar  newlinechar I like variable declaration before assignment not just because it makes closures easy, nor just because it makes mistyping variables more difficult. I also like it because it serves as a code signal -- implemented properly you _know_ at a glance that foo wasn't used higher up in the fuction, making refactoring easier. More importantly, it catches errors sooner; tests are slower than the compiler, and you won't be bitten if your tests don't provide full coverage (which in the real world almost never happens). newlinechar  newlinechar I think I can guess Guido's reasons for supporting nonlocal, and it's not a bad idea, but it skips the above problems.

No, this is not your point. You don't need a huge police force to protect the worker's right to strike but you need one to repress it.

The advances of workers' rights where gained through resisting police power, not controlling it. newlinechar  newlinechar Now if you are talking about the existence of any executive power to protect these rights, you are going to go to the library and read a bit on anarchism and it's many, many variants.

Since the lawyers are trustees for that money, they can't just take any left over. The settlement probably dictates how any unclaimed money is to be distributed - and I'll bet dollars to doughnuts it doesn't say that the lawyers get to keep it.

He said it, and has only backtracked now that he's in the spotlight. If he'd done so even 5 years ago, before his presidential bid, I might have believed you.

To rescind your claims only when it's inconvenient smacks of hypocrisy.

Even 'random' data in the form of a public key can be verified: have them sign a message with the corresponding private key. In general, though, I agree that it is unreasonable for a sufficiently complex message for any signer to make any absolute guarantees about its legitimacy or safety, but that is what they purport to do. newlinechar  newlinechar It seems that according to the definition for a cryptographic algorithm given [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual/html_node/Digital-signatures.html), MD5 is indeed broken due to the collision resistance requirement. But only when the same source generates both &lt;x&gt; and &lt;x'&gt;, not in general. I'm not opposed to using stronger hashes than MD5, I just want people to understand what is possible and what isn't. newlinechar  newlinechar This collision resistance requirement comes about because the signer is allowed leniency in authenticating a message. They are not required to verify its efficiency, to ensure that the message is complete and that every part of it is integral, that nothing extra is added. Perhaps this is a practical concession in the real world, but it really seems like a cop-out to me. When reading the election prediction paper, you get to the point where they explain the message is in the form of a PDF with embedded data and it's immediately obvious that this would put the message's legitimacy in question. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, the weakness opened up in MD5 is that a single source may be able to produce multiple messages with the same hash. But the only valid use of this hash is to verify that the message you received matches the one your source intends to distribute. The fact that the same source can now generate multiple (likely somewhat questionable) messages with the same hash doesn't change this, although it gets a bit more complicated when intermediaries like the console companies are involved. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, respecting an EOF character and aborting when you're supposed to be signing the entire message is a bug, an implementation error, plain and simple.

Give me a break.  Is that *really* molten steel?  All sorts of burning and molten crap was falling down; it could be anything. newlinechar  newlinechar I can't believe I have to spell this out for you. newlinechar  newlinechar You want to talk about extreme heat?  Let's talk about *burning* steel, *burning* concrete, from the combined factors of a raging fire in the upper floors, and the raw *kinetic energy* of falling mass during the building's collapse. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's talk about the sheer shock of the impact and explosion, which sent fireballs through the elevator shafts and shook the foundation.  Could this have possibly weakened the steel beams?  Hm.  The further shock of the final collapse delivered incredible stresses.  The beam could've been shorn, it could've been cut. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's talk about the timing of the building collapse.  It took more than an hour after the plane hit, to fall.  The collapse itself lasted on the order of minutes.  It's more than likely that crap fell on the broken beam after it was severed.  Gobs of molten steel were falling all around; you can see the effects plainly in other pictures. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's look at the distribution of the molten steel on the broken beam.  It it were cut using controlled burning, you'd see a more-or-less even distribution, with a tendency for more of the drippings near the bottom part of the cut.  Why are there portions of the cut that are clear of molten steel?  The bottom corners are devoid of accumulation. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's look at the molten steel on the beam.  Wait - is it even molten steel?  That beam must be ten feet across.  From this distance, it looks more like cement than metal.  Frankly, I can't tell what it is.  *You* say it's molten steel.  But forgive me if I'm not inclined to take your word at face value. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, let's look at the angle of the cut.  If you want to cut a steel beam, the easiest and most effective way is to make the break flat across the beam.  You can distribute more explosive in a smaller area, and make use of the compressive shock inside the beam, which would be more dispersed with a diagonal distribution. newlinechar  newlinechar So why make a diagonal cut?  Gee, do you think that the CIA agents who planted the explosives gave you little conspiracy theory nutjobs a little easter egg to discover?  Is it artistic flair?  Or maybe a shout-out to their friends in Mossad? newlinechar  newlinechar You look at this picture and see irrefutable facts.  What, are you an expert on building demolition?  Have you a lot of experience with cutting steel?  Were you there?  What credentials do you fall back on when you come up with your facts?

Yes, I know that.  Leads are what I'm talking about.  Just a crack in the official account.  A contradiction by a government source, another report of the same thing from a different perspective, anything at all referenced by the original theory (such as obituaries reflecting the strangely coincidental deaths).  If someone claims that the government of &lt;country&gt; is involved in a cover up of &lt;event with international consequences&gt;, there will be something in official accounts (the ones that get reported about by news agencies with websites) that is contradictory, extremely dubious, or at least a little off.  I'm not saying the whole process of investigative journalism should take place online, but claims about something this big would be able to be backed up (not proven, but helped) by something online independent of the original claimant's source.

I'm not saying the few haven't done a magnificent series of things.

&gt;...and Chomsky thinks a better candidate would be...? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm taking issue with your choice of word 'candidate.' The question of how to do things better is obviously an open debate, and chomsky has his opinions on that too (though not on this article). But it's not as though thoughtful historical analysis is without value. If you think that just throwing a Ron Paul or a Dennis Kucinich (or even a Ralph Nader) into the president's chair is going to fix everything then you're totally missing the point of his work. He does advocate a number of concrete ideas (universalism of morality, consensus building, opportunity implies responsibility, etc.), but just because he doesn't end it with a 'and that's why you should support XY next election!' doesn't make it 'not constructive.'
You think that barring atheists or Jewish people from owning property or holding public office is a MORAL issue and not a rights restriction? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You're wrong.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;things talked about in the 'We the People Act' relate specifically to issues of morality. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You haven't read the act then. Not too surprising, given that you don't seem to have read the Constitution either. It covers things like education as well, which is hardly a 'moral' issue. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It is the libertarian position that morality issues are to be decided at the local level, newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Nope, that's the *Republican theocrat* position. The Libertarian position is that moral issues are to be decided *by the individual without interference from the government.* Libertarians simply do not support taking Constitutional rights away from the individual and giving them to the state as privileges to grant or deny on a whim.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Being a Ron Paul supporter doesn't make you a Libertarian--especially when all that attracts you comes straight from the Republican playbook. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But even if this is truly what YOU want--to make it impossible to challenge state-level religious discrimination--you'd still have to amend the Constitution to nullify the 14th amendment. You simply cannot legislate away our Constitutional rights. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But seriously, you can give them up if you want. If you're unable to choose a church without your state legislature holding your hand, just call them up and ask them what they want you to do. No need to amend the Constitution to require everyone else to do it too. newlinechar  newlinechar

I respectfully disagree.  What I believe you are referring to is the fact that on a daily basis Humans engage in a wide array of emotions and actions, some of those may be less virtuous than others.  However, you cannot simply look at one action of an individual and conclude they are 'EVIL'.  It is far more complicated.  I have a simple sense of morality, as long as what you do doesn't hurt anyone, then what you do is 'moral'.  I believe that is as broad and abstract as a definition for morality can be.

Intuitively this seems like good philosophy, but we have just seen that it is actually a precise statement about mathematics, not just a vague claim about philosophy. For an ordinary claim ('Pat has a cold'), evidence in the form of a test that has a 99% chance of being correct is good enough to give you 92% confidence in the result. But for an extraordinary claim ('Sam has CNSV'), a test with 99% probability really doesn't help much; we would need a test with something like 99.999% accuracy before we will start to believe the claim.' newlinechar  newlinechar If by standard of proof you simply mean that the evidence must lead to the same level of confidence in any claim before you believe it then I agree with you.

You've just proved you haven't a drop of creativity in your body. If you did, you would be able to synthesize the concept that most people can't reason abstractly from talking to them. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The evidence that most people are incapable of 1) detecting logical contradictions, 2) processing logical syllogisms, 3) thinking logically, 4) and much much more (eg, structural identity vs essential identity, structure vs qualia), is incontrovertible. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That you cannot detect and then intuit obvious things from this evidence proves you lack all synthesis (the quality behind creativity) to such an extent that it is likely you are autistic.

Almost, but the analogy doesn't quite work. The difference being that the whole of Ireland (at that time) was part of a sovereign country called the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland' whereas India (like Canada, South Africa etc) was simply part of the British Empire. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, the term 'British' should probably only be used to identify someone/something from the island of Great Britain and 'Irish' should be used for someone/something from the island of Ireland.  newlinechar  newlinechar Note that neither expression correlates exactly with a nationality - as you can be Irish and have a passport of the Republic or the UK, and if you are from Northern Ireland you can have a UK passport without being British. newlinechar  newlinechar The bottom line is that people from these islands should call themselves whatever they want, and not get too precious if someone calls them something else by mistake.

For context, my job is working on ejabberd for an instant messaging appliance. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I just read the specification for the AMQP protocol.. pardon me but it seems a heck of a lot easier to follow than XMPP. newlinechar  newlinechar Uh, no. I think you misunderstand something about XMPP. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Going to xmpp.org and finding this didn't help with my confidence for XMPP: newlinechar  newlinechar Those are optional modules. XMPP is modular. You use as much as you need. Of course the core XMPP RFC isn't as functional as the whole of the (as far as I can tell) unmodular AMQP. The core is designed to be as minimal as possible. Then you layer on what you need. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, servers typically come with many of the additional XEPs pre-implemented for you, but the vast majority of them don't impact you unless you want them to. The modularity isn't _perfect_ (can't be, really), but it is pretty good. newlinechar  newlinechar There are entire concepts in AMQP that are either entirely optional in XMPP, or simply uncovered by any aspect of XMPP that I know of. The first means XMPP is simpler, the second means there are cases for which XMPP is not appropriate. There are also major XMPP extensions such as discovery that I see no equivalent for in the AMQP spec, probably because the use case for discovery is assumed to not apply in the AMQP world; you'll already know what every entity is and can do.  newlinechar  newlinechar XMPP started life as an instant message protocol, and the further you get from that use case, the worse off you are. It's easy for me to see that AMQP is designed for a different world, where messages are, on average, far more important than the average XMPP message, where the _usual_ message relationship is more complicated than one-to-one (XMPP of course has stuff to handle that, but one-to-one is the 'base case' of the protocol), and where processing speed trumps human comprehensibility where necessary. newlinechar  newlinechar On the scale of human to computer, XMPP is about as human-friendly as SMTP or HTTP. It looks like AMQP is much more human-hostile. Which one is better depends on your needs. newlinechar  newlinechar For a messaging product based on yet another set of needs, see [Spread](http://www.spread.org). This one is all about programs talking to programs, and also concentrates on many things XMPP doesn't. newlinechar  newlinechar Broadly, I'd say XMPP is better suited for internet-scale deployments where you need the human-friendliness and flexibility to work well. (There's a reason all the major Internet protocols are fairly human-friendly, often involving such apparent silliness as sending numeric error codes as ASCII numbers.) AMQP and Spread are much more useful for internal, controlled deployments where such friendliness doesn't matter. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I don't think XMPP and AMQP overlap much at all, and I doubt we'll be seeing much competition between them, any more than Exchange/MAPI really 'competes' with SMTP.

Insofar as he says everyone can program, he is a complete fucking moron. It is blatantly impossible. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Look, I have known people who write P and not P in consecutive paragraphs. They don't just believe in contradictory ideas, they believe in two *exact negations* separated by maybe 5 seconds in time. And it's not an 'error' since even after it's pointed out to them, *they don't see the fucking problem*! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's also an empirical fact that most people cannot handle logical syllogisms. They can't comprehend that 'if A then B, and A, then B'. And this isn't due to lack of education because we're talking about college students here. Hell, I have known professors teaching symbolic logic who don't comprehend logical syllogisms. Try to wrap your head around that one. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And to beat them all, I have known people who can't comprehend structural identity, even after an hour trying to explain it to them. They can't comprehend, and will not accept, that two molecules of CO2 are *absolutely identical* and that swapping their positions swaps their identities. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You see, they can't comprehend the abstract concept of an abstract concept because they *don't believe in the existence of abstract concepts*. Because abstract concepts *don't exist in their brains*. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now you tell me, how the hell is it ever possible for such people to learn to program *in any environment*? How is it even *conceivable*? You would have to be some kind of fucked up retard to deny the overwhelming empirical evidence. Evidence which is literally all around you if you will just open your eyes to it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you program then know this: most people do not think like you, most people CANNOT think like you, most people can never comprehend you. But you can understand *them* if you just learn the basic concepts that underpin their minds. Of course, if you do this, you will become elitist.

&gt;Using different currencies isn't a big deal. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think you're not thinking this all the way through.  Why?  Because if he revoked the legal tender act, and dollars no longer were manditory payment in the US, the first thing that would happen is that the dollar would become worthless.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar All of the money markets and investors would divest themselves of it immediately.  Why the hell would *anyone* keep investing in a currency if even its issuing government didn't believe in it any more?  Europe, China, etc would all rid themselves of dollars and the market would get flooded.  Foreign businesses would probably refuse to accept them all together. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Domestically, this would cause prices (in dollars) to skyrocket.  Maybe 100% American goods wouldn't be as badly effected, but the fact is, virtually nothing produced is truly 100% American.  Even on simple things like harvested foods, try keeping the prices down when gasoline is $50/gal.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And in the meantime, nothing is in a position to take up the slack and replace the dollar.  Sure, a bunch of people have invested in various gold commodities, but the economy sure isn't going to be able to switch over to a barter system overnight. (yes, with gold being traded as a commodity, it WOULD be a barter system)  How do you tell Visa or your bank that this month's payment is going to be an eighth ounce of gold?   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Life would probably be easiest on the border states.  Texas, Arizona, New Mexcio would probably just start trading in pesos, and similarly the northern border (myself included) would adopt the Canadian dollar.  But, of course, that's only good locally.  I have no idea if, say, my student loan holders would take a CA dollar.  I'd have to renegotiate every single debt I have.  And since all the banks that hold my debts are a lot more powerful than me, I'll probably get screwed in the deal.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I really have no idea what would happen in the middle of the country.  Probably just keep swapping dollars for awhile, despite the incredible inflation, and hope for the best.  Maybe start swapping chickens for wrenches.  They wouldn't just 'carry on.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The *only* upshot to Paul's plan is that, since the national debt is in dollars, this would effectively wipe it out.  The currency would be so devalued that the debt would become worthless.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But I don't think it's worth the hell he'd put the country through.

Stories are more then just lies, they are teaching tools, and have been a traditional way of passing knowledge for thousands of years. newlinechar  newlinechar The line between reality and myth can become blurry, and that is ok.  It's when people insist that the story is true, and to say otherwise is blasphemy that there is a problem. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider the story of Hansel and Gretel, on it's own it is a story that teaches about wandering away from home, being too trusting of strangers, etc.  When you are young with a active imagination the line between reality and that fiction may become blurred.   newlinechar  newlinechar The danger of wandering off into the woods and being trusting of strangers that offer to take you in and give you everything is real, however the reasons are manifested in fiction, rather then the real dangers.  As you grow up and mature the mythical reasons are replaced with real ones. newlinechar  newlinechar Santa is, when you really get down too it, a childs version of God.  He knows when you've been bad or good, he rewards good behaviour by giving presents, etc.  The lesson is good, be good and you'll get good things.  Eventually you grow up and realise that there is no Santa, but the principle is sound, be nice to people and people will be nice too you. newlinechar  newlinechar It is a story, that teaches a lesson in a 'innocent' way, and there is nothing wrong with it.  Eventually the child is meant to grow up, expand there understanding of the world and realise that it was just a story. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally I think it is wrong to take fantasy away from children, almost as wrong as it is for fantasy to dictate laws and government policy...

Furthermore, urban areas require extensive distribution and sanitation infrastructure, which, [by its very nature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly), needs to be managed by a single entity and does not lend itself to multiple suppliers. newlinechar  newlinechar Due to these realities, it's not difficult to imagine how a company with full ownership over water and no regulatory oversight could create artificial scarcity. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; That is unless they get the government to put in a bunch of bullshit rules and regulations to inhibit competition. newlinechar  newlinechar I fail to see how granting private ownership over water resources and eliminating oversight would encourage entrepreneurship. newlinechar  newlinechar If BigMcLargeHuge Corp owned a county's riparian rights and water utility, land owners could be forbidden from drilling their own wells. newlinechar  newlinechar Even if someone invented a method to extract water from sand, how would she be able to deliver the product to customers without BigMcLargeHuge's pipes? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; In other words socialism doesn't work. newlinechar  newlinechar Socialism is a broad concept.

I didn't actually mention foreign policy, but it is one of the issues with which I agree with Ron Paul as well. That, and his general ethos of personal liberty that will, among other things, abolish the 'war' on drugs. newlinechar  newlinechar It's true that things are so messed up right now in those respects that I can see why Ron Paul has so much appeal, since I have no doubt that he will fix those issues. newlinechar  newlinechar But unlike you, I can't overlook his stance on many other domestic and social issues. He's for scrapping income tax and the IRS, which explains why he's against a single-payer healthcare system and the welfare state. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it's a step backwards to dismantle all that, and will hurt many people. As for debating it later, it's always easier to tear things down than to build them back up again. I don't doubt Ron Paul's intelligence, I just don't think he's a particularly compassionate person. newlinechar  newlinechar Which is why I prefer Kucinich - there's no fear or war mongering to be found in his foreign policy, and he's right on the domestic and social issues. newlinechar  newlinechar And thanks for replying - it's usually suicide to be critical of Ron Paul on a reddit comments page!

&gt; The naive implementation article is a good argument against simplicity. newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree.  Simplicity only matters for things that actually work.  If I can remove a line of code which then prevents my code from compiling, it's not simpler, it's broken. newlinechar  newlinechar So to the extent that correctness is necessary, the naive version is broken and therefore how apparently simple it is doesn't matter. newlinechar  newlinechar However, it's much simpler then to have one authoritative version of the function, which is well-tested and analyzed, which is then both correct and singular, than having multiple equivalent implementations written with varying levels of naiveté and correctness, which then violates the DRY principle.

Fine - Smalltalk overall was much better than the JVM prior to hotspot.  It took a few generations to equal Smalltalk, and the massive hotspot enhancement (acquired from an experimental Smalltalk called Strongtalk) before they surpassed the best commercial Smalltalk (which is probably Visualworks).   newlinechar  newlinechar The Visualworks's VM is still fairly competitive (it has a JIT and is about half as fast on the Sieve of Eratosthenes) and on a tiny little item like this, there isn't a big impact on execution speed overall anyhow.  I found benchmark results here: http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.SpeedOfJavaCppRuby (search for Smalltalk in the page). newlinechar  newlinechar So, I think Gosling has been proven to be fairly clueless on this score.

Heh, you're actually probably right. newlinechar  newlinechar Honestly, I think you should learn the basics. Read the 'best' book on the language you want to learn. Learn it well.

I found it rather poor. Most of the corrections to so-called myths are just common wisdom. And in the case of psychopathy being untreatable, they are dead wrong. As a matter of empirical fact (not some yahoo's isolated opinion) psychological treatment of psychopaths is generally *negatively* effective. That is, psychopaths get worse through treatment. This is quite remarkable and puts an extraordinary onus on anyone claiming a treatment is effective. Now, Hare proposed a protocol which may work at curbing psychopaths' criminal tendencies, maybe, but it certainly will never cure their psychopathy. But given that society is better off executing psychopaths (the only justified basis for capital punishment is in fact psychopathy since *their very existence* is harmful to society) then having a reason to release them into the wild is certainly no cause for rejoicing.
Because in today's times, it's a crime to think!

The word 'sociopath' is the product of the idiotic PC euphemism treadmill. Worse than that, 'sociopath' is usually associated with newer definitions of psychopathy. Definitions which deviate from 'lack of empathy' to 'disruptive to society'. Nowadays, any dissident or subversive person is a 'sociopath' according to the DSM. You couldn't ask for better if you were building a Fascist state. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you wanted to re-use 'sociopath' to make it meaningful, you would not make it a washed out version of psychopath. Rather, you would analogize it to psychopaths. A psychopath is someone who doesn't see other psyches (they think of humans as dogs basically) because they lack empathy. A sociopath would be someone who doesn't see social rules (not just ignores them but is ignorant of them) because they lack whatever makes this necessary. But you know what? There already is a word for this: autistic. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So pretty much, 'sociopath' should be consigned to the dustbin of 'meaningless invented words' and 'an Orwellian assault on language'.

Very interesting.

No, very little is made with export in mind.  The market for Japanese movies in America is essentially nonexistent.  Perhaps you've seen The Ring?  That's what happens when a Japanese movie goes really successful - they remake it so that Americans won't have to watch Asians in leading roles.  Hollywood thinks we can't handle that and that subtitles make Americans cry.  They don't, but Hollywood wants to think they do (read the book 'Movie Wars: How Hollywood and the Media Control What Movies We See' for a long in-depth discussion of this kind of thing with regards to world cinema and twats like the Weinsteins). newlinechar  newlinechar There is a *LOT* of derivative crap.  A *LOT*.  The Grudge (Juon in Japan) was derivative crap that came long after Ringu and even Ringu was nowhere near first in the whole 'creepy little ghost girl with long black hair' thing.  If directors are making movies with pale jerky black haired girls with the intent of making bank in a Western market, they are failing miserably.  There are dozens of such movies cranked out every month from Japan and Korea (more Korea now), and pretty much all of them are ignored, even in circles that follow Asian cinema.  The groundbreaking Asian stuff is definitely not being made for a foreign audience - a lot of it COULD NEVER come out for Western audiences.  Battle Royale isn't licensed for distribution in America and probably never will be.  The subject matter would get uptight housewives losing their mind.   newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, that movie that won an Oscar, The Departed?  That was a ripoff remake of a Japanese movie called Infernal Affairs.  If the people who made Infernal Affairs did it to get their movie recognized in an American market, they failed pretty badly... they scrubbed that movie of almost all eastern influences.  Not sure if they did a competent remake, I didn't see it.

Xbox Live from Microsoft makes sure that every game developed for their service is vetted through their 'portfolio management' group of nazis.  Sony has similar plans for PSN and exorbitant prices to even start developing for their platform.  Nintendo just ignores anyone who isn't Japanese.  Steam on the PC side takes massive chunks of revenue and has a high bar of entry as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The companies that currently provide, or are providing in the next few years, an online distribution infrastructure that could enable such a market if they would simply ALLOW it, are crippling their services.  They know this is going to cost them money.  They have seen YouTube.  They have seen all of the online ventures that only benefit from openness, and yet they still close off their systems.  Also, if you talk to anyone involved in the game development business you quickly learn that it is a very insular and hierarchical group with elevated aristocrats lording over a sea of peons expected to work 100 hour weeks for months on end to crank out another movie licensed megabudget hunk of turd for an uberpublisher.  For small game companies the goal is to be cannibalized by one of the uberpublishers.  No one can really speak up because it is so easy to get 'black balled' if you don't 'play the game'.  And don't get me started on how far the dying retail market will go to put the stop to any of these online distribution models.

I was helped in learning how meaningless GPA was to an engineer when I received an A- in a gym prerequisite. I complained to the teacher that it ruined my perfect 4.0 and anyway that I had the top grade in the entire class. Still it didn't matter to her and from that point on, I was released from trying to be perfect. newlinechar  newlinechar Prior to this travesty of justice I treated all my class choices by my planned route of safe bets. Afterwards however I was then able to take classes that stretched beyond my comfort zone in both prior experience and interests. 
It appears that when derogatory words are combined with the words Rudy, Huckabee, and/or Hillary in reddit headlines, it induces a desire to click any up arrows within close proximity of the subject.
Jeeze, some people aren't happy until they can make a kid cry. I'm not teaching my son to be a moron. I'm just letting him believe in magic for one more year. He's going to grow out of it, why should I shove it down his throat? newlinechar  newlinechar And where did I say anything about the church? Actually my ex-wife is converting to Judaism so the kids are celebrating Hanukkah and Christmas this year. I'm an Agnostic but I don't see any reason to take away the holiday. I see it more as a celebration of the Winter Solstice, since, lets face facts, the Christians made Christmas at this time of year to horn in on the pagan's Winter holiday. newlinechar  newlinechar I do agree with you, it is easy to disprove Santa but why? If you don't go crazy with buying a million presents what's the harm?

Yeah, I would gladly pay $10/month for a package of BBC 1, 2, and 3.

Anyone who knows the 911 timeline knows that Pakistani ISI acted as overseer and paymaster for al Qaeda and the 911 leader Mohammed Atta; and that most of al Qaeda and the supposed 911 hijackers were Sunni and Saudi.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But what is curious here, and why I suspect a Red Herring is being dragged across the trail, is there is no mention of Israel's and Mossad's part in 911: the dancing Israelis, who were allowed to go back to Israel by our current DOJ head Mukasy, and were treated as 'heros' on Israeli TV; and the Israeli 'Art Student' who cased our defense and DEA facilities just prior to 911. Not a word.

Very worrisome. Paul is not a libertarian. Or, rather, he is a one of those special American breed of libertarians, those who support an intrusive powerful government, but only on a state level. There was, at one time well over 100 years ago, a legitimate debate over the appropriate power of the various levels of government. For a variety of reasons, perhaps some structural, the states rights party melded into the racist bigot government control party. For a very long time 'states rights' has been a code word for keeping the nigger down and upholding the power of rich white males. It might not have to be that, but it is. Paul talks Constitution and freedom, but his actions are in close step with the white southern racists in trying to keep the feds out. Me, I am for *individuals* rights and *individuals* freedom and don't care what level over government is involved. newlinechar  newlinechar

So if using incadescents matters more to some people, they can make up for the extra environmental damage by providing extra money to the government that can be used to reduce ommissions in other ways? newlinechar  newlinechar There's no reason to ban something outright if a price hike will get most people to stop using it, and the consequences of a few people continuing to use it at the higher price aren't very severe.
I said he'd have a better understanding, having had to care for woman &amp; child.  I don't think he's for taking away anyone's rights perse.  I don't want another president chosen solely on the abortion issue, though, regardless of their stance. newlinechar  newlinechar He's for the checks &amp; balances via congress and the judicial branch.  Leaving it for states to decide might be the wisest thing right now.  It's not the 1970's anymore!  Geez!
by the way... You don't even have to sell the guy. He sells himself. He has a voting record that makes 98% percent of the Democratic Party look like NEOCONS. 
The question of marriage should never go to the  federal courts. Paul would vote for the bill to make sure it never goes to the federal courts. That is not inconsistent. I agree with it - on the Federal level.  newlinechar Marraige should not be a legal issue at all, gay or straight. For things like taxes, estates, Hospital Proxies, anyone gay or straight should be able to designate a partner as that legal entity - no overhead or forced law. A couple who share expenses and a home should be able to legal designate each other in all legal endeavors - even with out being married. Paul supports this. He says get the government out of ALL our bedrooms. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Marriage is a church issue. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: and see, now that someone has taken the time to explain why another candidate might be better, I will have to do some research and see how I feel about the candidate. Who knows, maybe I will change if I see more and more positive analysis on someone. But here on reddit, I see only Ron Paul - positive and negative, so now I have the most complete knowledge of him as opposed to other candidates.

He says similar things when he talks about keeping the government out of people's lives.  He doesn't approve of prostitution but believes that consenting adults should be able to do basically whatever they want with each other.  He doesn't like drugs but, again, believes that informed adults have the right to take drugs if they like. newlinechar  newlinechar His position on abortion is that he personally finds it very distressing.  He's delivered a bunch of children, let's give his opinion some weight.  His policy position is that the federal government should not be involved in the issue.  He wants the states to legislate it.  I don't see what the problem is.  newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT:  I missed the main thrust of your post.  His job as a legislator isn't to *enforce* laws, it's to create laws.  He *should* be identifying the laws he thinks are wrong and getting them changed.  It's his job.
What annoys me is her generalization. newlinechar  newlinechar That citation likely does not even reflect the view of the majority of pro-lifers much less all of them. Certainly, there's no way to define what percentage of pro-lifers hold the view Paige claims they do.

This is the part I would like you to explain. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I actually really wanted to try to explain that it doesn’t come from me directly, but the campaign aides said that’s too confusing. newlinechar  newlinechar Why would anyone in their right mind allow racist words written in their name to stand. Why did he not immediately issue a retraction? How on earth would that be confusing? I dare you to answer these questions without further ado. I dare Ron Paul to answer them.
The girls have been missing for ten years.  When they found Shawn and Ben, the cops looked at Devlin for a while, but after extensive interviews, they concluded that he had no sexual interest in girls and did not pursue him as a suspect.  That wasn't ased on their pre-conceived notion -- that was the truth of the facts.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And the fact that child sexual abuse is underreported, espesially for boys, does not in any way prove that gender preferences aren't there.  Anecdotal evidence is evidence, nonetheless.  The 'scientific' studies are very misleading.  Just this week, I was researching the percentage of abuse incidents that leave physical evidence.  The studies are all over the place in percentages (ranging from very high to very low), and the one that is cited most frequently for the prosecution (96% show no physical signs) doesn't even say that 96% of *abused children.*  Instead, it is instead *suspected abuse victims,* which includes children referred because their grades had dropped!
Seems like an obnoxious feminist trying to stir the pot. Stop paying attention and she will slowly shrivel up and float away.
&gt; Seems you are unaware that sperm donation is anonymous ... newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, [anonymity has ceased](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4397249.stm) in the UK, so your first premise is wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; In the original example, the child's rights are not protected. newlinechar  newlinechar How is the difference relevant? In our case, the child has two mommies, and a friendly uncle figure. In a typical sperm donation, there are two parents, and the sperm donor vanishes.  How does the latter case protect the child? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The donation laws are, I imagine, designed to protect that interest. newlinechar  newlinechar But the donation laws are not what you say what they are. And they were changed *from* what you say they are (anonymous, to non-anonymous) to 'protect the child's interests' by allowing them to learn of their father. newlinechar  newlinechar I see a whole chain of dubious reasoning. newlinechar  newlinechar 1. sperm donation is non longer anonymous in UK. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. the anonymity was for the benefit of the *donor*, and non-anonymity is for the benefit of the child. newlinechar  newlinechar 3. donor anonymity was always *optional* anyway.  There is no evidence that the arrangement being discussed would have been against the rules of sperm donation, if it had been carried out through the normal clinic system. newlinechar  newlinechar 4. you have no evidence that the contract was verbal.  It could be so, but it is not supported by the available data. newlinechar  newlinechar 5. The agreement, verbal or not, does not appear to be disputed.

I guess that would automatically mean he had no access to young girls? :-| newlinechar  newlinechar It's not irrelevant if the person is attracted to young boys, but not young girls. The point of your post seems to be that pedophiles don't see a difference because children lack sexual characteristics. newlinechar  newlinechar However, that 'lack' is clearly objective (they're not developed sexually), and does not mean a pedophile necessarily does not view them differently, notice their differences, and even have the ability to subjectively prefer one to the other. newlinechar  newlinechar That has nothing to do with whether a pedophile has a preference for boys or girls, regardless of whether clinicians (currently) say he may or may not have adult sexual preferences.
I'll quote why, newlinechar  newlinechar 'Before the scientific discovery that human development begins at fertilization, English common law allowed abortions to be performed before 'quickening', the earliest perception of fetal movement by a woman during pregnancy, until both pre- and post-quickening abortions were criminalized by Lord Ellenborough's Act in 1803.[92]' newlinechar  newlinechar As an example of how things worked back then.
I don't understand your point.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I never said that autoboxing was bad, just that Java's implementation of it was. If they had done it the same way that C# did, we wouldn't have the kind of weirdness that the author mentioned. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The same goes with generics. Generics in Java are certainly better than no generic, but they could have been so much better. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As for type inference, the only question in my mind is how far do you go?
That's really interesting. So in that way, the Mac is a good platform for starting out as an independent developer; you can use the shareware model at first, reducing your initial investment, and then, later on, expand to other markets.
Wrong. The Loose Change kids never went to college. Korey Rowe had been discharged from the Army, and Dylan Avery couldn't get into college (poor grades) and was selling drugs prior to making the film. They were basically a couple of kids who had a little money and a lot of free time on their hands. Alex Jones does not make money directly from the film, but as a leader of the conspiracy movement he does have a vested interest in bringing in more believers.   
this is a personal bias but newlinechar 1. i would prefer an explanation rather (or as well as) then 'like pythons yield'. newlinechar 2. what up with the one letter variable/function names?
Conception is 'often used synonymously with fertilization but, medically, is equated with implantation.' The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) considers the term 'conception' to mean implantation.

Well, it's how he picked out his car.  Made sure it was an inline-4. Milage, seating, Price, craftsmanship, all the other qualities that will affect his life on a daily basis, those were set aside so a fact that will have the least impact on his life, or the lives of anyone he meets, will be totally fulfilled. I imagine he even has a bumper sticker on it, next to the pro-choice sticker, that reads 'I [heart] inline-4!'  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm VERY pro-choice.  But one issue voting is re-tar-ded.  newlinechar  newlinechar the chance of Paul or the government met being able to return the US to no-abortion land is ZERO. population limiting (birth control, abortion) is a fundamental tenet of modern, first world countries. If the citizens never had free access to abortions to begin with, then yea. There would be a good chance it would stay the same.  But we couldn't even keep booze away from the American people, I doubt they could do the same to anything as big nowadays.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, Even though I may not like his position on abortion, I will be voting for him.  And why he should too.  newlinechar  newlinechar There will never be a 100% good candidate, so take the best you can find.  ( Giant Douche vs Terd Sandwich anyone?)
&gt; This is not them simply being in denial; this is in terms of physiological responses. The sexual attraction to children is a paraphilia, not a sexual orientation. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, I understand what you mean.

That and having marble-sized balls didn't hurt either.

Not all children are mindless idiots who do nothing but drool on themselves while watching TV. While I certainly don't approve of it, there are ten year olds quite capable of willingly entering into a sexual relationship with full knowledge of what they are doing.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Before you start making pronouncements about what someone is or is not capable of understanding, you should do some research into what actually happened. Then, and only then, can you say what this particular girl did or did not know.
What a civil debate. How disorienting. I agree that nobody should be insulted for speaking correctly (even though our ideas about 'correctly' don't quite match up). In fact, I think it'd be a better world if fewer people harangued others about their language -- correct or not -- in the first place. 
I think that's the ideological equivalent of setting a small section of the school on fire, and then calling it a 'fire drill.'  That's seriously disturbing.  Did it make the news at all?

There's no reason in the world a high school student should have to make that kind of ethical call under that kind of pressure.

One Sunday, a priest asked one of the church janitor if he would cover his Confession shift for him -- he said it was easy, since he had a sin list inside the booth which listed both sins and penance.

This was easy, the janitor thought. Another person came into the booth. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. I have committed the sin of oral sex.''Oral sex, huh?' He looked at the list, but didn't see oral sex there. So, he excused himself to look for help.

We see how much respect Bush had for international law when he invaded Iraq, unprovoked.

well I thought the same - kind of shocked me once I realised. It does have some tricky special form rules to allow it, but essentually scala is 90% library implementation. which is really really powerful.  newlinechar  newlinechar Its much simpler grammar then java. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, '+' is a method (def).

I just wish it would take off more. Part of the problem is its very heavily pushed from the functional angle, all the docs are in pdf and read fairly academically.

That you're not getting my point about this pretty simple matter of interpersonal communication does, however, suggest something. newlinechar  newlinechar When you communicate with the recruiter, but by being standoffish leave out essential proof about your interpersonal skills in a situation in which you're expected to communicate all facts positive towards your application, the recruiter isn't going to spend a lot of time wondering whether you might be holding back something as major as this.

I'd guess by undermining it and inserting the trunks under it and then rolling it out of the shallow hole.

Allow me to give you another perspective.  A good friend of mine dropped out of his degree with 3 courses left.  He went to work for Raytheon.  10 years later, he absolutely regrets not finishing his degree.  Not having the degree is constantly getting in his way even though he is very technically adept. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, if you want to work in another country you'll pretty much need a degree to get a work visa.

If I were to do it all over again, I would do so without hesitation.
You can refine the rule further by removing Scheme and Java from it.
Pretty much, yeah.

I'm not as libertarian as I used to be, and certainly not ancap.  I think it's unrealistic to think that any significant majority at this moment in history are going to approve of just opening the flood gates and allowing anyone and everyone into the country regardless of criminal background, education and or real skills.  I see the logic behind increasing the power of the federal government by increasing immigration laws, but really, why bother even having a country or Constitution.  The ancap dystopia isn't going to happen for another 30-40 years, imo.  I certainly think that eventually, nation-states as we know them will cease to exist and everything will just be small enclaves of people who have various ideologies in common, whether they be economic, cultural, religious, intellectual etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I also don't buy the argument that, well, in the 19th century (when we had _much_ less population and virtually no socialized infrastructure that people got dependent on), we didn't have immigration laws like we do now and there were record numbers of immigrants pouring in, therefore it would be exactly the same result now if we went back to that.  To make a fair comparison, you'd have to find a point in history when we previously had a massive state, immigration laws with little enforcing them and record numbers of illegal immigration, then switched suddenly to no federal government with no immigration laws and no borders.  If you profess the type of altruism that is implied by your statement 'enforcing immigration laws will result in more poor people dying because they will be unable to improve their economic outlook by moving to the US.', you ought to take a step back and think about the poor people in THIS country who to this day compete with people who are so desperate that they will clog the infrastructure we've all been paying taxes on all these years, not to mention the elderly who are already beginning to suffer from illegal immigration.  You know, nationals. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly, I will say that I don't care at all about poor people in other countries dying by not being able to move here.  At all.  I don't buy that neo-liberal crybaby bullshit and I think it's fake, contrived and is used as a sort of Godwin's law to guilt people into some twisted reason for you to believe their extremist concepts about people so disconnected to you you'd be more humane to consider the plight of the animals that are slaughtered for your food instead.  If it's so fucking tragic, why doesn't anyone in their country declare an emergency so people can at least declare refugee status and get proper care through the Red Cross, UNICEF and so on?  Next you'll be saying we should open the borders or else we can't save the children.  Think of the children!  More like, think of overpopulation. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Why didn't they rise up to replace Fox or the new guy or redistribute Carlos Slim's probably ill-gotten wealth?  If we're going to have a law, it should be enforced.  If it's not enforced, it sends a message that the law is to be circumvented if possible.  At that point, why bother having any laws at all?  In the meantime, it's not fair to the people who do follow them. newlinechar  newlinechar 
It is very common. The child slave markets were created by the missionaries. They profit off of it. In some cases, they even brainwashed the parents into thinking they were going to 'serve god' or be 'saved' and the corrupt govt does not do anything about it.. This was thier way of controlling the population. Lots of children are brought into this kind of abuse.. once they are old enough to walk they are sold off, and what is even more sickening, some regions, the parent's allow this to happen, becuase they are desperate. The whole situation is terrible over there and religion has made it worse.
WTF are you talking about?  He was telling you to go to IRC.
&gt; Most male pedophiles -- even those whom prefer boys -- are heterosexual; the sexual characteristics which arouse them are female. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you have citations to demonstrate this? newlinechar  newlinechar This source: http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html newlinechar seems to show that the data are spotty. One can conclude that pedophilia is *often* a separate preference from hetero- or homo-sexuality, but one cannot conclude that 'most male pedophiles -- even those whom prefer boys -- are heterosexual.'   newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, one study (Erickson, 1988) claims that 'Eighty-six percent of offenders against males described themselves as homosexual or bisexual,' but this study is dismissed by the  author of the page because it fails to differentiate between gay and bisexual offenders.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another study (Marshall et al. 1988) found that 14 of 21 offenders against male children were more aroused by female adults and 7 were more aroused by males.  So on the one hand, from this tiny sample you are correct that most male pedophiles that prefer boys are hetero; on the other hand, gays are over-represented at 1/3 of the sample relative to their 1/20 share of the population.

Mainly due to laziness and preexisting bulb replacement contracts. newlinechar  newlinechar I worked for a state DOT for 3 summers during the time of the switch to LEDs.  It was a no-brainer.  A typical intersection without LEDs was around $1000/month to operate.  With LEDs it was about $5.

You've got me all wrong.

Thanks for the kind comment! Well, I'm not too sure about the price. Pricing is so much harder than coding that it's sick. newlinechar  newlinechar I described the pricing history in the comment above. I've always received about the same number of complaints about the price (few), and sales have grown more or less steadily. Many sales are from companies too. newlinechar  newlinechar Even if I'm totally positive that programmers don't like buying software tools, I nowadays tend to think that I'd be doing better at $99. I think we programmers err on the side of selling too cheap more often than  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also quite liberal with sending out discounts. Part of the thinking is that if the actual, real, only problem is the price, the person will at least drop me a line (some people do). Interested fellow redditors, feel free to drop me a line and I'll give you a nice discount. newlinechar  newlinechar Except for the support issues (which are a big burden for a one-man-band), I'd love to sell 4x as much at $29 - but I think it just wouldn't happen. I think most of the price sensitivity comes in the gap from $0 to $10, the jump from $10 to $79 only accounts for a few extra lost users.
or we could sit around on reddit organizeing a meetup of redditors to be trained into an elite fighting unit.
I understand you may be very busy. I didn't mean otherwise. I just think you should add that into the equation and do something to work around that, if you really want to find out how this works. newlinechar  newlinechar Step 1: forget game development as a possibility. I've been a game programmer for 10 years, you probably don't really want to go there, and for sure you don't want to go there on your own. It's not a good way to go independent. newlinechar  newlinechar Step 2 (this is an easy and enjoyable assignment): read every single post in Patrick McKenzie's blog [http://microisvjournal.wordpress.com/](http://microisvjournal.wordpress.com/). His tagline is: 'The schedule: 8 days. The budget: $60. The results: read on.'. He's now making about $2k a month, but only because he didn't choose a very juicy market. His strategy is near perfect, he explains every little detail on the blog, and his 8-day-schedule mindset is brilliant. newlinechar  newlinechar Step 3: chose something you can do in 8 days and do it. You can go up to a couple of weeks if you need it, but if you start thinking about months you're already digging your own tomb. You'll never do it if you have a busy schedule. Once it's done, put up a website and put it up for sale. Even if you end up selling just 5 copies, you will have learned so much that it'll be worth it. Take it as something just for fun and learning, rather than as an obligation.

Yeah, religion usually is.
My argument was based on the assumption that all possible gods will only reward worshipers, and punish atheists.

Captain Obvious, is that you?
No, he believes the U.S. has lost its way as a republic. One of the ways he wants to change it is to 'restore' religious values.  Which just means breaking down the federal system and bringing more power to the state level.  Once you've brought it to the state level, a lot of states would be free to decide, as an example, whether their schools should teach from the bible instead of current national school books.  And the really scary part, is that moving alot of this responsibility back to the state level is going to cause a very serious degree of infighting amongst the states on who now is responsible for what.

I've done a bit of both, and generally tend to work for large companies (contracting mostly) since I actually do end up making more money for my time that way than I have with any of my independent efforts.  The maximum earnings I can achieve this way is nowhere near I can achieve with a successful startup, but the loss of earnings with failed businesses can often be more than a stream of employment income.  In other words, if you can work smartly with your money while employed you can often turn out as wealthy as someone with a successful business.

&gt; The Environment would be fine in a free market. Nuclear power would at least be an option.

I've never understood why this doesn't get more attention. RP would've used the Constitution (this year!) to make abortion murder in *every* state, if he'd gotten his way.

It would've empowered a new gang of 'uterus police' that would make the war on drugs look like a warm hug from an old friend.  newlinechar  newlinechar The kindest thing you can say about HR 1094 is that it is an incompetently, recklessly drafted bill... which, upon reflection, is simply inexcusable when the fact is taken into account that its primary author was a obstetrician and gynecologist.  newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I find this same kind of recklessness in his entire platform, but even if you don't, you're lying to yourself and others if you promote the notion that RP wanted to leave the matter of abortion to the states. He didn't. He wanted to make abortion murder in every state, and make embryos and blastocysts citizens of the United States.

We are actually in agreement.  If you read through the second sentence I wrote, you'll notice that it implicitly acknowledges the Israeli Arab population (which is something like 1.5 million I think), but this is a minority of the total non-Jewish Arab population within Israel's current borders, even if you exclude the Gaza Strip.

Well, for clarity's sake, there is no monolithic HOR. The question is was any one doing this for political gain, specifically any Reps or anyone under the orders of a Rep. It's entirely possible that these guys wouldn't know an IP address from their own ass, much less think about the issue. So I wouldn't be shocked if people were under order (and paid on the tax-payer's dime) to alter this information for political ends.

&gt; If you're going to have a language of that type Python or Ruby are far superior newlinechar  newlinechar Neither Python nor Ruby are weakly typed, and their respective cores are *much* more extensive and heavy than JS. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; JavaScript is the modern day Basic. newlinechar  newlinechar You sound like a backend guy who never accepted to actually learn JS, and always considered it as a toy language. newlinechar  newlinechar That's funny.

How do you define 'big'?  Ada is a general-purpose fully object-oriented programming language, ala C++ or Java.  A few years ago I read comparisons of Ada with other language in terms of keyword count and other naive measures of programming language complexity, but can't seem to locate any of them now.  Ada always came off favorably in these measures, which were undertaken mostly to counter the popular misconception that Ada was a complicated, unwieldy language. newlinechar  newlinechar You're free to review the [specs](http://www.adaic.org/standards/index.html) themselves and draw your own conclusions. After the initial release of 'object-based' Ada 83 there came the fully object-oriented Ada 95 and now the recently approved Ada 2005 standard. newlinechar  newlinechar Informally speaking, as one well-versed in the language, the specs and the language itself are well-designed, consistently defined, and with very few 'gotchas' that programmers have to be mindful of.
&gt; But the funny thing is most religious people give themselves outs, where all they have to do is pray, or believe Jesus died for their sins, or repent, and then they don't have to worry one bit about their responsibility for any of their actions. newlinechar  newlinechar Define 'most religious people.'  If you're limiting your claims to America, where Protestants are a clear majority religiously, then it might be true.  But the traditional (and still majority worldwide, these days) Christian understanding of justification is very much different than the view you describe: Christians must still suffer the temporal punishment for their sins, they simply aren't going to go to hell for them.
Fabulous win.
You assume the consumer market can afford more expensive chips. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Right now it's looking like 300 dollar home PCs soon to be 100 dollar home PCs. If you want to win this market you got to optimize, because you can't afford the losses from packing in new transistors that haven't been paid for upstream. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly world wide there's a much bigger sub $300 PC market than there ever was a $2000 PC market. And what's driving the $2000 PC market? Why that would be GPUs and software that takes full advantage of the GPU architectures. Intel and AMD are also rans in the high end PC market when determining the majority reason for purchase. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Eventuallys someone is going to get smart and realize that the vidoe game console market will subsidize the sub $300 PC market and at that point those whose software is optimized GPU architectures will make Intel and AMD irrelevant. That is if the CPU makers don't do something about this right now, by demonstrating their value in the only application that matters outside video games - the browser. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Since Microsoft killed off the shrink wrap market by suing Netscape, they essentially killed off software design economy that gave Windows it's dominant mindshare. Coupled with their over bundling/DRM strategy that has prevented Vista from braod adoption, Windows itself is looking irrevant on the sub $300 PC market. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Why pay more than 10% of the cost of the machine for the operating system? Especially when Ubuntu and friends run Firefox better, even without the CPU architecture optimizations. Do people really want to pay for Windows so they can run the DRM pooched Windows media player and use IE 7? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's all Microsoft could do to muscle the harddrive makers out of creating a network hard drive market, these last 3 years. Why pay 600+ dollars for a Windows Home Server, when you can buy a Buffalo network Drive for $175? If the home user is smart enough to use Windows Home Server, he/she is smart enough to run linux. And if you can make FPS shooters run on PS2/3 $300 architecture are you telling me you can't run Office and web browsers ridiculously quickly on the same platform?  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, a decade after the dot-com announcement, the base hardware is powerful enough that the Network PC is not only viable by mandatory. And that means hardware optimizations to distinquish between hardware offerings.

In your three years and a half at your college,  you could have added solid gold toilets as well and whatsnot if you had run a casino instead of a football team.  Gambling brings in more money than professional sport,  and when you own the casino,  you win every time,  unlike running a sport team.  Another side business in manufacturing and retailing recreational drugs would get you a lot more bucks too for a much lower investment. Not to mention the earning potential of all these cute young students who could turn tricks with minimum coaching. This would provide marketable skills to more students than just the few jocks that benefit directly for the athletic programs,  and thus more directly support the educational mission of the college. 
Subsidizing?  I think dave's point was the the coach's salary will pay for itself. newlinechar  newlinechar The coach wouldn't get paid millions of dollars unless lots of people were paying money to watch the football team.

&gt; I'm guessing the only reason the more sound approach wasn't taken was that it didn't provide the political benefits to Roosevelt, as it would have been decades before people would need to start drawing out funds. newlinechar  newlinechar At the time, Roosevelt and other New Dealers didn't forsee the huge population bust coming.  In those days, for every 14 citizens paying in to the trust fund, only 1 was being paid out to.  They didn't suspect we would contracept and abort away our workforce to the point where it was reduced to 3 paying in for every 1 paying out. newlinechar  newlinechar It's the same story in Europe.  Due to incredibly low birthrates, countries like Spain and Italy are required to have a certain amount of immigration into their countries each year just to keep the economy growing.

&gt; The problem is that if you raise capital gains tax, you reduce the benefit for people to invest in businesses that provide the goods and services we all use. newlinechar  newlinechar Sounds to me like economists doing a cost-benefit analysis on that would solve the problem (won't be easy, though). There is likely one or more optimal rates where the entirety of the costs caused by the two problems are minimized.
Citation needed for a pet theory?  plex has all but said, 'hey, this is an idea I think sounds good and I'm looking for evidence for or against.'  That doesn't mean it's claimed as true.  None of us can have personal hypotheses?  Or can we not mention them until we have hard proof?
Pricing software is hard. It's hard to find your break even point, and pricing it as a regular manufactured product is a lot harder because of production costs (which is where everything happens) and lack of distribution costs (internet download are virtually free--I say virtually, as I'm sure you pay for bandwidth). newlinechar  newlinechar If your main target is corporate teams, then it makes no sense to drop the price for the once-of type of customer (like me).  newlinechar  newlinechar I find it interesting, though, that the product does well for Visual Studio users and Windows users overall. Vi is (was?) part of the Unix world, and the Windows vim port is more for the nostalgic need to use vi--the first program I install in my Windows machines is the latest vim editor. Vi is a great editing tool, but new users think it too user unfriendly to give it a try. newlinechar  newlinechar Nonetheless, if increase in sales is what you need, I would start looking into typical marketing research to try to find out what people are really willing to pay. And if the individual consumer like me is not buying your product because of the cost.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think at $29, I would buy your product. The question is how many cheap-o developers like me are not buying at $79, but would be willing at $29. You will never know unless you do some research.  newlinechar  newlinechar You may be surprised at how many are out there, actually (unless you did research and didn't find that many). For starters, fresh graduates would be willing to buy it, I'd think. Most universities (good universities), use *nix based computing environments where vi and emacs are the norm. This demographic doesn't have the money to spend on 'cute' tools. On the other hand, it could be argued that these graduates are entering the corporate world and can influence their managers to buy your tool. However, they really don't have that much power to suggest spending on these things. Of course, recent graduates are part of the P2P generation and the concept of buying software is alien to them. Even to me it is. I don't mean that stealing software is OK, but there are many free options out there. newlinechar  newlinechar I think in the corporate world, the reception  to your product is good when a previous vi user is managing the team and thinks (like many of us) that vi is a more productive coding editor. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, I'm sure this is just redundant dribble, but I do think your niche product is quite interesting. I have never heard of it until now, but I'm more of the Eclipse and NetBeans type of user--both of these tools have freely available vi ports. newlinechar  newlinechar Good luck, and I hope you continue converting those Windows developers into vi users.

It trips me out when I run into people who claim blacks aren't discriminated against at all and don't understand why they are so sensitive and upset about discrimination, but the second they don't get into their first choice of college or the job they want they assume it is because of affirmative action and just rant and rave about how unfair it is.

Ok, I see what you're saying and there are some arguments that yes we should stop publicly funding sports programs.  Though I completely disagree.  How do you feel about high school sports?

The unwritten subtext of all the 'Asian Pacific Americans also benefit tremendously from affirmative action programs' lines is that it should say 'Asian Pacific Americans also benefit tremendously from affirmative action programs, at someone else's expense'.

For that to be really efficient, you need to hoist the checks out of loops, so you essentially have duplicate code-paths specialized to the two possibilities (fixnum vs bignum), right? So you have a slow pessimistic version that works with arbitrary integers and then a fast fixnum version. What happens if there's a promotion while executing the middle of the fixnum-specialized function? Do you jump directly to the corresponding point of the bignum function and continue execution? That seems like it could prove difficult. Maybe I misunderstand what you're proposing.
'Take a good look around! The middle class is already well on its way to destruction,' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes.

I agree.  It isn't the same kind of expression.  The atheist poster implies a cause and effect relationship between fervent belief in fairy tales and violent action.

It's far more difficult to leave a native country than you'd think. You can't just hop on a plane as if you were going on vacation. newlinechar  newlinechar First, you have to choose a nation, then you have to figure out how you are going to make a living there, then you have to go though a series of immigration hurtles to legally move. Add the psychological strain of leaving friends and family behind, and it's easy to see why so many claim they will leave, but never do. newlinechar  newlinechar One has to be *absolutely sure* things are not going to get better locally before the idea of immigrating sounds desirable. newlinechar  newlinechar Sadly, increasingly, educated Americans have come to this conclusion. newlinechar  newlinechar It's difficult to explain to people who haven't traveled abroad how dysfunctional American culture is. newlinechar  newlinechar In civilized countries it's not a matter of public policy to allow the mentally ill to wander the streets, no one goes bankrupt because of an illness or accident, and, most importantly, a civilized population values representative democracy.  newlinechar  newlinechar That last point strikes at the heart of why I feel the United States is almost beyond hope: We have a significant percentage of Americans who define 'democracy' as 'mob rule.'

What isn't covered, but what everyone should consider is this gives us more time to get the alternatives to a useful point.  There are a lot of interesting renewable projects out there.

Nice link. i'll have to spend some time with that one. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree that equal right does not equal special rights - except when the language has to be explicitly written into standing laws. AND new laws written. Affirmative action being a prime example. Ideally there should be no need for this. But if there is a need, then gays should be included in the language. But then the business world will just have another government quota to meet - a forced quota that has nothing to do with the abilty of a gay being the best candidate. newlinechar  newlinechar I would like to see different implementation of affirmative action. I am not sure what and how, but maybe something along the lines of a better business bureau where complaints can be lodged for perceived discrimination and investigated instead of forcing a company to have a minimum of 3 gays, 3 non-whites, and one scientologist working for them. newlinechar  newlinechar Discrimination is hard. If I were a hiring manager, I might truly pick another candidate over a scientologist because I really have issues with my opinion of their intellect if they can believe in Xenu. newlinechar  newlinechar Thats my problem, not theirs. But the checks and balances of my discrimination has to come from within me - not forced by the government.

It's not quite that simple.  As mentioned below, scripts running on different pages can interact to some extent. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides that, there are typically resources within the browser engine that may need to be shared between threads to improve performance such as in-memory caches for images, scripts, pages, etc.  Interactions with browser plugins such as Flash or QuickTime may be another problem point.  Individual plugins would have to support being accessed on multiple threads.  As plugins have traditionally been accessed from the main thread, they may use mutable shared state without locking or may make calls into the OS that are unsafe when not performed from the main thread. newlinechar  newlinechar It's definitely an area worth exploring, but there are many barriers which prevent this from being as simple as 'just use one thread per page' like some people expect.

You’ve touched a very sensitive topic there.  newlinechar  newlinechar The current view is that *all men are created equal*.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is not a scientific view, but a personal, ethical (and indeed noble) view. Adherents to this view often reject any contrary views out of hand. This is similar to the way in which Religious fundamentalists stick to the *creationist view* and reject any evidence to the contrary.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are however several pieces of evidence that points out that there are differences between races (read populations).  newlinechar  newlinechar Why would two geographically separated populations follow the same evolutionary path? Yet we assume that everyone has the exact same innate abilities.  newlinechar  newlinechar An example is the [average IQ]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:National_IQ_Lynn_Vanhanen_2006_IQ_and_Global_Inequality.png) for different areas of the world. Obviously, race is not the only factor in the determination of IQ – cultural views, education and poverty. However, we should ask ourselves, how big a factor is poverty in the determination of IQ?  newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, there was discrimination against Jews (not only in the USA) for an extremely long time (cf. Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice). For instance, the Spanish inquisition was to flush out Jews in Europe. Yet they are on average more successful than European people – who were not the victims of discrimination.  newlinechar  newlinechar Why do Jews have such a disproportionate share of intellectual accomplishments? (Ludwig von Mises, Einstein, Sylvester comes to mind).  newlinechar  newlinechar I think that there is a lot of evidence that points out that people of Jewish and Asian descent probably has an average higher intelligence than European people.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are several questions I want answered before I will believe that the differences between races is superficial: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Why do Jews/Asians have higher average IQs than Europeans? newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Why are there that many rich Jews or Jews with Nobel prizes? newlinechar  newlinechar 3. Why do black people dominate athletics? Especially 100m, 200m. There are 1bn Chinese – yet they can not produce a decent 100m athelete.  newlinechar  newlinechar 4. Why is there a difference in performance of different races, even when they have the same education? newlinechar  newlinechar 5. Why is there a difference between the developments of countries – even when some of the countries were practically destroyed? (e.g. Japan after WW2, The rise of South Korea, The rise of China+India).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My personal view is that all persons should be treated equal – but there may be a difference in the abilities of different groups.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Sorry, I see some of the points were mentioned in the article.

I'm abivalent about 'hate crimes', but I think their advocates claim that such crimes are similar to terrorism. By lynching a black man in the South, the Klan hopes to terrorize all blacks into submission. Similarly, attacking a gay man because he's gay is usually an attempt to 'control' the gay population through fear. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Otherwise, why would a terrorist get a harsher penalty than anyone else for setting off a bomb? If we remove motivation from criminal laws, then terrorist would get the same sentence as any garden variety criminal. Are conservatives OK with that? newlinechar  newlinechar

1 milligram of actual conversion of matter into energy yes, but you need a fair bit more of the original radioactive material, since the vast majority of matter is conserved in a radioactive decay.  For instance, in tritium, one atom of tritium would give 2809MeV of energy if converted entirely to energy, but beta decay only gives off 18.6keV of energy (a ratio of about 150000).  So to get that 20W @ 5% for 12 years, you really need about 150g of material, which is still pretty good.  However, the power output of a radioactive source is not constant, since it is proportional to the number of undecayed particles, which (obviously) decreases in time.  
If you want to be literal, 'refactoring' would be more like changing the plants that line the road or renaming the exit; topics I fail to find interesting.

This can be used to do IO (the state contains the 'world' or holds some 'special' object), mutable state (trivial), 'nondeterminism' (the next statement is invoked multiple times or never) etc. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with monads and fp is that most programs needs some kind of mutation (at least for IO, but often for other things too) and instead of creating real functional solutions, monads are used to build an imperative sublanguage on top of the pure fp base and the real program in then implemented in this sublanguage. It doesn't really matter if you use unsafePerformIO  or a state monad: You've left fp-land and are back to imperative programming. newlinechar  newlinechar

The difference between the 1880 estimate and the 1960 estimate is one has a valid mathematical model (Hubbert Linearization) that has made valid predictions (the US 1970 peak oil output was predicted by it) and the other was just fearmongering based on the previous peak whale oil episode. newlinechar  newlinechar Since Megaprojects take several years to come onstream, a 2011-2012 total Peak Oil seems the most likely at this point. 4 years is hardly enough time to spend the trillions needed to retool our global energy supply. It seems very likely that we will face energy supply crunches for the foreseeable future, renewable investments or not.
I remember those rectifier diodes. They came in steel tubes (which I doubt stopped anything) and had 'danger: x-rays' printed on them. They were remarkably simple inside; just an cathode at the base, cup-shaped anode at the other end and a heating element. I could never get a high enough voltage across them to light up a fluorescent tube though.

Oh no. In the name of atheism suggests an atheist doctrine to rid the world of non-atheist-believers. If that happens, atheism is AS BAD AS the atrocities of other religions.

I think such a market system *would* work.  The question is how to construct it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Most strategies for converting externalities into actual costs involve some sorts of government intervention (e.g. imposing fines for environmental damage). newlinechar  newlinechar Another strategy is to remove information asymmetry so that customers can accurately assess the true cost of a product.  newlinechar  newlinechar The second solution is the one I would prefer because it doesn't require the creation of another power structure (government).  On the other hand, I don't think most of the world has an educational system in place that can foster the kind of critical thinking necessary to achieve the second solution (where individuals research and understand what companies are doing to create products).

Ah, so they just teach the propaganda that rainman spoke of. newlinechar  newlinechar The most important thing to grasp is that this was pre-ballistic missiles. The launch sites had to be in range of the target. Cuba posed a threat as the missiles were in range of Washington. newlinechar  newlinechar What they don't teach in America is that the US had just deployed missiles in Turkey that could reach Moscow. This gave the US the ability for a first strike, taking out Russia's heart before any retaliation was possible.  newlinechar  newlinechar Meanwhile, the US had been bullying and trying to assassinate Castro. They were funding terrorist groups to attack targets on the island and kill those they deemed enemies. Castro turned for help to the Russians who saw it as an opportunity to level the playing field and counter the threat from Turkey. If the US launched from there, they could retaliate which in theory ought to be enough to hold the US back from attacking.  newlinechar  newlinechar The biggest single lie that is taught in America is that Kennedy got the Russians to back down. What was actually negotiated was that while Russia removes the missiles from Cuba, the US would also remove theirs from Turkey. Both sides held to the deal and WW III was avoided.  newlinechar  newlinechar And it truly was avoided. All of Kennedy's advisers wanted him to take the first strike option, before the missiles were operational.

Divorce is not condemned in the Bible. Jesus said that divorce was allowable on the grounds of adultery (Matthew 19:9, 5:32). Any woman in Clinton's position, from a Christian standpoint, would have had suitable grounds for divorce. newlinechar  newlinechar In any case, I think porcelain was only pointing out that if one is irritated by whatever candidate's support of wifely submission, one ought to be irritated at Clinton as well, who apparently showed such submission (I would call it more forgiveness than submission, though). newlinechar  newlinechar By the by, as a Christian wife I would like to point out that I, personally, have no objection to a wife being in subjection to her husband (as outlined in the Greek scriptures). 'Subjection' doesn't mean 'slavery,' and it doesn't devalue the woman in any sense, any more than an employee being in subjection (in work matters) to his employer devalues him. The arrangement can be abused, however, and so if it's going to work it's important for both husband and wife to see it in the right way. The Bible does say that a wife is to be in submission and have respect her husband, but it also says a husband is to love and cherish his wife. It takes humility and respect for each of them. newlinechar  newlinechar I realize, of course, that folks interpret the Bible differently. In any case, there are certain interpretations that can work out quite well. :)

One flaw in the reasoning in this video is the idea that the planets are formed by impacts from small bodies that come from random directions, and all with the same momentum. The spin of the planets is because they are formed by collisions among smaller bodies that are already rotating around the Sun. Loosely speaking, they transfer their rotation to the forming planet. Of course, there is a degree of randomness in this, so a collision with a particularly large body, as you expect towards the end of the formation of the planets, can significantly alter the rotation rate and axis of a planet, at random. This would explain the anomalous rotation of Venus, or Uranus. It's interesting that we can observe this process happening around another star, Beta Pictoris, which is surrounded by a spinning disk of debris, and where a [violent collision](http://www.gemini.edu/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=117) between orbiting bodies has happened recently. newlinechar  newlinechar The four large moons of Jupiter (the Galilean moons) are thought to have formed together with Jupiter, out of a disk of material spinning around the planet, like the larger nebula spun around the protosun. They orbit Jupiter in the same direction, as expected. Other moons are small, irregular bodies, wandering planetesimals in fact, captured by Jupiter's gravity. These would have approached Jupiter originally from random directions, so they would not be expected to orbit the planet in the same direction.  newlinechar  newlinechar The statement that the gas giants could not have formed spontaneously because gas dissipates into space is ludicrous. The giant planets' gravity is quite sufficient to retain hydrogen atmospheres. The terrestrial planets, on the other hand, are much smaller and their gravitational pull is weaker, and they can't retain hydrogen. Mercury can't even retain any atmosphere at all. Our planets can retain thin atmospheres of heavier gases - fortunately for us! newlinechar  newlinechar The statement that the Moon's composition is very dissimilar to the Earth's is just plain wrong. In fact, the composition of the Moon is remarkably similar to the Earth's crust. The favored theory of the formation of the Moon is by an impact with a large body. [Computer simulations](http://www.swri.org/press/impact.htm) show how the Moon forms out of the debris ejected from the Earth by the impact. newlinechar  newlinechar The formation of the solar system is a fascinating story, built up from observations of the dynamics of planetary motion, analysis of meteorites, and of course more recently, exploration by spacecraft, and in the case of the Moon, by humans too. It's a much more interesting story than the creationist magical fantasy.

While both [Sinterklaas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinterklaas) and Santa have their origin in the 4th century Christian bishop of Myra [Saint Nicholas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas), they are regarded as two completly different persons in Belgium/The Netherlands. Both have red clothes and a long white beard, but Sinterklaas comes from Spain while Santa comes from the North Pole/Rovaniemi (Finland). Sinterklaas also comes earlier: the evening of December 5th or the morning of December 6th.

In my experience it's that the instruments scale in difficulty differently. A guitar is easy to play a few notes on, but a massive shredding solo requires a lot of effort and skill just because of the way the instrument works.

No doubt those CEs have a sampling bias by working in areas where the calculations are done.

Generally the design didn't work, and the engineer came out to look, once he understood what we were talking about he told us what to do on the spot without doing anything on paper.   One time the engineer came out and told the foreman 'I don't know how to fix it, so make something work and I'll draw that up and certify it'.   Of course houses have a lot of margin for error, so I'm sure there was no need for calculations, but they clearly were not done. newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt; Chances of that happening are orders of magnitude less then the chances of being denied for racism. newlinechar  newlinechar Bull-shit! I applied for over 30 bursaries when I was undergrad.

According to this article, it's not the finance wizards. It's the loan issuers.  newlinechar  newlinechar Loan issuers such as Countrywide Financial committed fraud. These are the guys you go to and ask for a home loan from. They made bad loans, which were riskier than they claimed. newlinechar  newlinechar They sold these loans to the finance wizards: Morgan Stanley and other investment banks, various hedge funds, etc (not banks you can walk into the lobby of and ask for a loan). These guys knew how to package loans, but relied on accurate risk assessments from the issuer (much like how a life insurance company relies on accurate age and health information).  newlinechar  newlinechar The 'finance wizards' are the ones who got ripped off. This maneuver is covering the asses of the loan issuers, not the 'wizards'.
Incidentally, the Danish name for New York's Statue of Liberty is Frihedsgudinden, meaning the Goddess of Liberty. I'd love to see someone film the reaction of Sherri Shepherd as she's told this, that America's greatest national symbol of liberty is a pagan goddess whose main temple functioned as a brothel. How much do you want to bet she'll deny it all by claiming that the statue is a depiction of a Christian saint? Or perhaps the Virgin Mary--now that would be ironic.
Actually, this would be British colonialism, I believe.
Let's get real. The WSJ's editorial board has a long, ignoble history of not actually reading the news pages when it takes editorial positions. Murdoch didn't buy the paper and transform it - he bought it because he recognized kindred spirits.

Why should open source implementations be left out with regards to audio or video due to the HTML5 spec using patent-encumbered audio or video codecs that won't be publicly usable for at least 15 years or more?  That would be plainly unfair to the free implementations that can't pay the per-user patent license fees.

&gt;Just then, instead of facing the music, they step out of the conversation, and declare 'BS', a statistical lie, and so forth. newlinechar  newlinechar The only music to face is how big of a statistical lie these polls really are.   newlinechar  newlinechar These polls represent a severely skewed demographic who believes that if they 'get loud' their views will be spread.  How do they 'get loud'?  Here is one example:  they flood an online poll, all vote in a certain way, and then circulate these polls on sites like reddit and digg while they represent them as the gospel truth.  This happens almost daily on reddit (see any online Ron Paul poll for a citation).   newlinechar  newlinechar This behavior is both immature and self serving which is a big reason why the general public does not take these kinds of supporters seriously (see Ron Paul's non-internet poll results for a citation).
Ethics have nothing to do with law.  Law is an arbitrary set of commands made in order to alleviate a problem that may have existed at one time, but more often than not, that law becomes useless and often detrimental to society as a whole, so it needs to be broken. newlinechar  newlinechar This is about more than just sharing music.  It's about the outdated and broken intellectual property system that our country employs.  It's about freedom of the internet.  It's about fairness to consumers.   newlinechar  newlinechar You don't have to break the law if you don't want to, but don't call those of us who do 'unethical'.  newlinechar  newlinechar ...and, by the way, I *don't* pirate music, but I don't buy it either.

That is a great point. I don't know exactly where Ron Paul was back then on those issues. But here is what I do know, I voted for Bush in 2000, and looking back that was a huge mistake.  I was just a kid and was brought up in a sheltered, social conservative environment where you did not question conservative politics. My modern positions are radically different from those I once held. People shouldn't have static ideas, they should be adjusted as new evidence presents itself.   newlinechar  newlinechar As for this election cycle, I support Ron Paul, Kucinich, and Obama in this contest. I think any of them would generally move America to a better direction. They are all very critical of the government/business collusion. I just bring up Ron Paul here because he does tend to have a lot of reddit support and he does seem to be critical of the establishment that is poisoning democratic debate in America. newlinechar  newlinechar Ron Paul may have supported Reagan's policies, but I suspect this support wasn't universal. Anyone know exactly where Ron Paul stands on clandestine intelligence operations?

Exactly. All those 'anti-war' lefties aren't really anti-war, they are lefties, democrats, anti-right and anti-republican. newlinechar  newlinechar They like to demonstrate and complain against the war, but given the opportunity to actually end it, other things come first: Abortion, national health care, strong federal government, freedom from religion, opposition to intelligent design and, most of all, staying in power. newlinechar  newlinechar Why don't they just admit it? Peace is way down on their priority list. newlinechar  newlinechar Sometimes I think that the **only** reason they are against the war is because Bush and the republicans started it.

It's a combination of the two.

You're saying that a **recession** is when growth stops, but doesn't fall? That doesn't even make sense, the word recession coming as it does from the word **recede**, which means 'to diminish'. A depression is a much more severe recession - for example, where the GDP declines 10% or more. You can have a recession without growth stopping, and you can have one where growth falls, but it's not a depression until it falls very steeply and far (and you can have a depression without contraction).

'On any given night in America, anywhere from 700,000 to 2 million people are homeless, according to estimates of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty.' http://www.policyalmanac.org/social_welfare/homeless.shtml newlinechar  newlinechar There are 300 million people in the US.  That means that anywhere from .2% to .7% of the population is homeless.  That means that 99.3% to 99.8% of the population has a home.    Most, if not all, of those homes have electricity and running water.  A vast majority have TV, cellphones, cars, and internet access.  I say that while the divide between the rich, the not so rich, and the poor may be wide, the poor have never been better off in the history of man. newlinechar  newlinechar Someone really needs to explain to me why it's bad that there are people out there who make hundreds of millions of dollars more than me, because I don't get it.

In my view they did try to increase liquidity, but with no faith in the banks the fed couldn't do it.  The same thing could happen again this time.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This is also from the Wikipedia page, quote from Marriner S. Eccles (a chairman of the Federal Reserve): newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;...Had there been a better distribution of the current income from the national product -- in other words, had there been less savings by business and the higher-income groups and more income in the lower groups -- we should have had far greater stability in our economy. Had the six billion dollars, for instance, that were loaned by corporations and wealthy individuals for stock-market speculation been distributed to the public as lower prices or higher wages and with less profits to the corporations and the well-to-do, it would have prevented or greatly moderated the economic collapse that began at the end of 1929. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The time came when there were no more poker chips to be loaned on credit. Debtors thereupon were forced to curtail their consumption in an effort to create a margin that could be applied to the reduction of outstanding debts. This naturally reduced the demand for goods of all kinds and brought on what seemed to be overproduction, but was in reality underconsumption when judged in terms of the real world instead of the money world. This, in turn, brought about a fall in prices and employment... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I am sure Ben Bernanke will write a nice book too when he's done, just like Alen Greenspan.

To most people, whether or not Joseph Smith was a con man is clear if you carefully review the evidence.  Most religions cover up any inconsistencies by telling you that you just have to have blind faith in certain teachings, and that you should not question them.  If you indoctrinate a child young enough into a belief system, that person can seldom see the world outside of what they are taught, no matter how obviously flawed.  Most of us accept things on blind faith outside of religion, such as the size of the earth, or even that there are other planets in the universe.  Most people haven't been to Mars, so they just accept that what they are taught about Mars is true.  This is based on provided evidence that seems rational and is provable, but more important is 'falseafiable,' meaning we could disprove it if it weren't true.  With most religions, however, the teachings are occasionally not rational and not provable, and never 'falseafiable', so it can't be debated.  You either believe it or you don't.

&gt;Are you suggesting that while it is possible to use 'creative accounting' to invent false gains for one purpose, it is somehow not possible to create paper losses for another purpose? newlinechar  newlinechar No, I am not suggesting that. I should be more precise. Enron didn't make their losses 'disappear' completely, they just hid them in other financial statements that no one was looking at, but they were still there. newlinechar  newlinechar So from an accounting perspective, to be more precise, you cannot just delete losses, or input gains into your financial statements. You could of course technically write in incorrect figures, but they ultimately must be backed up by some real world evidence, such as receipts and bank account balances. You cannot create or destroy income or losses through accounting; however, through creative accounting, you can determine to which accounts and at what times those transactions apply. newlinechar  newlinechar The dispute with Paramount Studios is difficult to delve into, but Paramount wasn't getting any free lunch per say. They cannot just create expenses without having the records of the transactions to prove it. newlinechar  newlinechar What they did is take losses that should be applied to other parts of businesses and apply them to that individual production so as to make that production unprofitable. In terms of the whole company however, they have not created any losses. The same amount of losses, companywide, would have been recorded regardless of what production they are applied to. So Paramount did not create losses or destroy income; they merely moved it from one business project to another. newlinechar  newlinechar That isn’t to say that Paramount couldn’t take money out of their bank account and then fabricate receipts from companies that they supposedly purchased services from, but such an action is not in the realm of creative accounting. That is straight up fraud. newlinechar  newlinechar The distinction probably seems trivial, but it is not. newlinechar  newlinechar So what is the purpose of accounting, how do you determine if the particular accounting procedure is correct, and how do you determine if it is illegal? newlinechar  newlinechar The primary purpose of accounting is simple: To provide information that is useful for decision making. newlinechar  newlinechar To determine if the procedure is correct, it must fulfill the primary purpose while being relevant, reliable, comparable, and consistent; among other things. newlinechar  newlinechar Determining if it is an illegal procedure in civil suits is a hairy web of agency relationships and contracts; that is why we have Judges. newlinechar

Thanks for your thoughtful reply. newlinechar  newlinechar First, I don't have any number to back me up (because I couldn't find a number anywhere supporting or refuting my claim) but you argued the number of guns in the US up to 96 guns per 100 people.  To equate it to our discussion here, we should be talking about the number of times someone has used their gun vs the number of times someone has used drugs. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, I don't have any numbers to back me up, but I'd be really surprised if you can show me numbers that back you up.  Or in other words, I bet there are more drug uses per capita than there are gun uses.  Proof to the contrary is welcome. newlinechar  newlinechar But even if I am wrong about that, I still maintain that guns are a self fulfilling prophecy.  As long as everyone around you is armed to the teeth, there is quite the incentive for you to do the same.  A civilian arms race is not exactly a recipe for a caring, understanding society. newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree with you about my national nuclear weapons question, but that is just my opinion.  You are consistent with your logic (national vs personal weapons) so I can't fault you there, even if I disagree with you. newlinechar  newlinechar Would you advocate every individual having nuclear weapons?  Why or why not? newlinechar  newlinechar And to your 'shootings in malls, schools, and churches' example - as long as guns are legal in some places but not in others, then yes, your prophecy with fulfill itself.  Crazy people will be able to easily get guns in one place and use them in another.  But I suggest that the better situation overall is not to have everyone armed but to arm no one. newlinechar  newlinechar I live in downtown Toronto (joked as the only Canadian city with real hardcore American style crime) and I've never once been afraid of being shot.  I think I've seen one gun in my life - a rifle at my father's friend's farm when I was a kid.  I've never known anyone who was shot or even shot at (outside of people in the military).  We are safe in Canada not because everyone is heavily armed, but because (by and large) no one is.
